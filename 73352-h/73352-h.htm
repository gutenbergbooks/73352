</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I am</span> an orphan,” reflected Lydia Raymond, with
immense satisfaction.</p>

<p>She was a very intelligent little girl of twelve years
old, and she remembered very well that when her
father had died out in China, three years ago, it was
her mother who had been the centre of attention and
compassion. People had spoken about her poor dead
father, and had praised him and pitied him, but their
real attention had all been for the widow, who was
there under their eyes, pathetic and sorrow-stricken.
Lydia herself had been “poor little thing,” but Grandpapa
and her aunts and uncle had all told her that it
was her mother who must be thought of now, and she
knew that they kept on saying to one another that “the
child will be a comfort to poor Mary.” Her own individuality,
which she felt so strongly, did not seem
to count at all, and Lydia had, quite silently, resented
that intensely, ever since she could remember anything
at all.</p>

<p>Once her mother had read her some extracts of old
letters from her dead father, letters which had once
come so regularly every week in thin blue envelopes
with the Hong Kong postmark.</p>

<p>“Kiss our baby Lydia for me. I hope she is a good
little thing always ... some day, when these years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
hard work are over, you won’t have to sacrifice yourself
any more, my poor Mary....” And, later on, in
the last letter of all: “The child’s life is only a continuation
of ours, my Mary.”</p>

<p>Long afterwards, Lydia, who never forgot the
words, came to see them as the expression of man’s
eternal wistful attempt to live on in the generation supplanting
his own, but when her mother read them
aloud to her, in a voice choked with tears, something
in Lydia revolted violently.</p>

<p>“My life is my own,” she thought stubbornly, “not
just a continuation of somebody else’s.”</p>

<p>With that acute clarity of vision that enabled her to
analyze certain aspects of her childhood’s world with
such astonishing maturity, she once told herself:</p>

<p>“They don’t love me for myself at all. Grandpapa
doesn’t love me the least bit—he doesn’t love anybody.
And mother loves me because I’m <i>her</i> child, and the
aunts love me because I’m father’s child, and they think
I’m a comfort to mother.”</p>

<p>She could hardly remember her father, and though
at first she had shed tears over his death, Lydia had
quickly dried them.</p>

<p>“Now, dear, you must be a good little girl and not
cry and make poor mother more unhappy than she
is already,” had said harassed-looking Aunt Evelyn.
“You know you must think of her now. You’ll have
to be her comfort.”</p>

<p>And almost immediately afterwards Aunt Evelyn
had said to Lydia’s mother:</p>

<p>“Do, do give way and cry, dearie. It will be so
much better for you. I know you’re wonderful, but
you’ll suffer for it later on. You’re bound to.”</p>

<p>After that it had not needed Aunt Evelyn’s further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
observation that “poor little Lydia didn’t know what
her loss meant” to dry Lydia’s perfunctory tears with
the sting of an inflexible pride.</p>

<p>She would not cry again until they were prepared to
concede to her the major right to affliction!</p>

<p>She did not love her mother very much. It is more
common than is generally allowed, for an intelligent
child, still in bondage to her natural instinct, reinforced
by the tradition of allegiance to natural authorities, to
couple that allegiance with a perfectly distinct antipathy
to the personality of either or both parents.
Lydia’s dislike of her mother’s sentimentality, her constant
vacillation of purpose, and her incessant garrulity,
was only unchildlike in her calm analysis of it,
and in the conscious restraint that she put upon it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond had often said, sometimes in Lydia’s
hearing, that she would welcome death.</p>

<p>“But for little Lydia, I think I should have put an
end to it all long ago. But how can I leave her, when
she only has me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond, however, without any intervention
of her own, when Lydia was twelve years old, reached
the haven to which, since her husband’s death, she had
so often aspired.</p>

<p>“I am an orphan.”</p>

<p>Lydia, already a dignified and self-contained little
girl, bore herself with a new, pale composure.</p>

<p>It was for her that Aunt Evelyn, once more summoned
from her shabby, untidy house at Wimbledon,
was now hastily ordering mourning, and to whom the
Wimbledon cousins had written brief, blotted letters
of compassion and sympathy, and it was her future
that Aunt Evelyn and Uncle George and Aunt Beryl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
had all been discussing under their breath whenever
they thought she was not listening.</p>

<p>This, at least, was Lydia’s complacent conviction,
until she overheard a few chance words about Grandpapa,
and how best they could break it to him, when
he was old, and his heart was weak—and he had,
besides, never really got over the shock of poor Peter’s
death, three years ago.</p>

<p>So it was Grandpapa they were thinking of now!</p>

<p>Lydia really felt very angry. Grandpapa, however,
did not exact an undue amount of attention, on the
whole.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa is old,” said Aunt Beryl, with a hint of
apology in her voice. “Very old people don’t realize
things quite in the same way—they’re more familiar
with grief, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“The real blow was poor Peter’s death,” said Aunt
Evelyn, also determined that Grandpapa should be
accredited with his due meed of afflictions.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl, who lived with Grandpapa, took Lydia
to stay with them.</p>

<p>They had a house at the seaside, only two hours by
train from London, and Aunt Evelyn came with them,
ostensibly to see how Grandpapa was, but in reality,
Lydia felt certain, in order to help them to decide upon
her own future.</p>

<p>The two aunts talked to one another in anxious
undertones all through the journey; their two, almost
identical, black hats nodding so close together that
Aunt Beryl’s hard straw brim kept on knocking against
Aunt Evelyn’s stiff, upstanding bow of rigid crape.
Although the younger one was still unmarried, Lydia’s
two aunts had never lost a certain indefinable similarity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of taste that always made them look as though they
were dressed alike.</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn was Mrs. Senthoven.</p>

<p>“You can remember it because of Beethoven,” she
always said, with a nervous laugh. She had three
children, and was several years older than her sister.</p>

<p>Miss Raymond might have been handsome in a
small, beaky way but for her extreme thinness and the
permanent anxiety in her light-brown eyes. “Beryl is
the youngest bird in the old home nest, and is always
with dear Grandpapa,” Aunt Evelyn and Uncle George
were apt to say.</p>

<p>The youngest bird in the old home nest, growing
yearly more pinched and vulture-like, invariably
acquiesced eagerly in the pious formula, and thus enabled
Aunt Evelyn to give her undivided attention to
the straitened, clamorous household at Wimbledon, and
Uncle George to leave his room in Grandpapa’s house
untenanted during his fortnightly holiday from the
office.</p>

<p>Now, however, he was at home, having gone straight
back after the funeral. He met them at the station.</p>

<p>Uncle George was small and fair, with a habit of
asking thoughtful questions of the kind apt to provoke
hasty and inaccurate replies, which he then had the
satisfaction of correcting.</p>

<p>He said, “Well, well, Lydia,” and gave her a little,
awkward pat on the shoulder, that she quite understood
to be expressive of his pity and sympathy.</p>

<p>“What about the ’bus?” said Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Aunt Evelyn protested quickly. “The
walk would do us good. No need to take the ’bus.”</p>

<p>This was one of the fundamental differences between
the aunts and Lydia’s mother. Mrs. Raymond had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
always taken a cab from the station, whether she had
brought any luggage or no, when she came down to
see Grandpapa. She had never seemed to be aware,
as Lydia had privately always been aware, that the
household in Regency Terrace thought very much the
worse of her for the extravagance.</p>

<p>“The ’bus could take your bag, Evelyn. I know the
man,” said Uncle George. “It will be quite all right.”
He put out his hand for the small, dirty, brown suit-case
that was weighing his sister down on one side.</p>

<p>“Well—I don’t know,” she hesitated. “I suppose it
will be sixpence or more saved, if we carry it ourselves.”
She laughed nervously.</p>

<p>“Better let the ’bus take it. I can say a word to the
conductor,” persisted Uncle George, now burdened
with the bag.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t far. I think I’d rather keep an eye
on it.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like.”</p>

<p>Uncle George raised his eyebrows, and they trudged
away down the dusty station road.</p>

<p>Lydia was tired and hot in her new, fussy black
clothes, and the contrast between her present discomfort
and those condemned, self-indulgent ways of her
mother, in the advantages of which she had always
shared, brought a genuine realization of loss to her
mind with a dull pang.</p>

<p>“What made your train late?” Uncle George inquired,
patiently shifting the suit-case into his other
hand.</p>

<p>“Was it late?”</p>

<p>“Surely. Wasn’t it, Beryl?”</p>

<p>“I think it <i>was</i>. About five or ten minutes.”</p>

<p>Her brother immediately looked astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Five <i>or</i> ten! The railway company would tell you
that there is a very great difference. As a matter of
fact, your train came in exactly seven-and-a-half
minutes behind time.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we started late,” wearily suggested Mrs.
Senthoven. She was beginning to limp a little in her
tight, black boots.</p>

<p>“Not very likely to do that. Probably you lost time
at the Junction. The two-fifteen always has to wait
about there. I’ve noticed it.”</p>

<p>“Probably that was it,” said Aunt Beryl, with tired
acquiescence in the masculine infallibility on the subject
of time-tables.</p>

<p>“I expect it was that. Let me see—you would have
stopped only once before the Junction——”</p>

<p>The discussion, if it could be called one, when the
only wish of the aunts was obviously to agree with
Uncle George, lasted all the way to Regency Terrace.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Evelyn and Aunt Beryl both said, “Here
we are!” and Uncle George put the suit-case down upon
the lowest step of the stone flight that led to the front
door as though by no possible feat of endurance could
he have sustained its weight further.</p>

<p>“There’s Grandpapa,” said Mrs. Senthoven, looking
up at a first-floor window, and nodding vigorously.</p>

<p>“George!” exclaimed Aunt Beryl reproachfully,
“why is Grandpapa in the drawing-room? You know
he always sits in the dining-room on week-days. With
the parrot to keep him company and all.”</p>

<p>Her brother was spared the necessity of providing
any explanation as to Grandpapa’s disregard of his
privileges by the opening of the front door.</p>

<p>“Welcome, my dear child,” said Aunt Beryl very
kindly to Lydia, and she kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Then she looked round sharply at the servant who
had opened the door. Her face relaxed at the immaculate
cap and apron that met her gaze, and she
said graciously:</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Gertrude.”</p>

<p>As they went into the dining-room, of which the
door already stood open, Lydia heard Aunt Beryl say
in tones of satisfaction:</p>

<p>“The girl really is improving at last. I’ve had such
a time with her!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could get our girl at home to look half
so smart,” said Aunt Evelyn, shaking her head. “But
she’s got more than she can manage, with the house
in the morning, and then the waiting at meals—Robert
absolutely insists on that—and half her time she
doesn’t dress in the afternoons at all, and I really can’t
blame her. Just goes to the door with her arms all
turned up, anyhow. Not that we have many callers,”
sighed Aunt Evelyn. “I’ve had to give over social life
altogether, practically; the children take such a lot of
seeing to. Don’t ever marry a poor man, Beryl.”</p>

<p>The fiction still prevailed between the sisters that a
choice of matrimonial projects lay ever before Miss
Raymond.</p>

<p>“If you ladies have finished talking secrets——” said
Uncle George, in reproachful reference to the rapid
undertones employed by Lydia’s aunts.</p>

<p>“Yes, now what about Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“He’ll want to see our little Lydia.”</p>

<p>“Poor child! Get her a little wine and a biscuit
first, George.”</p>

<p>Lydia sat complacently at the square dining-room
table, whilst Uncle George slowly unlocked the lower
half of the sideboard and brought out a decanter with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
a very little red liquid in it, and Aunt Beryl produced,
also from a locked receptacle, a small glass barrel
containing three or four Albert biscuits.</p>

<p>“You sit here quietly, dear. Aunt Evelyn and I
will go up to Grandpapa first.”</p>

<p>The aunts left the room together, and Lydia and
Uncle George remained solemnly facing one another
across the dining-room table. Lydia was much too
self-possessed a little girl ever to feel any necessity
for making conversation, and as her uncle remained
silent, she occupied herself in gazing round the dining-room,
familiar though it was to her already. The
table was still covered with rather worn red baize;
Grandpapa’s arm-chair, in which Grandpapa should
by rights have been sitting now, still stood in the bay
window, flanked by the small, round table which supported
the parrot’s cage. The cage was covered with
an old piece of green stuff now, and Lydia was glad
of it. She was not at all fond of the parrot. Over
the mantelpiece hung “The Monarch of the Glen,”
and over the writing-table, at which no one ever wrote,
but where Aunt Beryl did a good deal of sewing, was
“Derby Day.” Lydia had heard Aunt Evelyn say
that the detail in that picture always struck her as
being quite wonderful.</p>

<p>The sideboard was the largest piece of furniture in
the room, and it occupied almost the whole of one
end of it. Lydia had often been told the story of the
sideboard’s arrival at Regency Terrace—the impossibility
of getting it in at the front door—Uncle George’s
humorous suggestion that the roof of the house should
be taken off—and finally its lengthy and strenuous
entrance through a window, assisted by a large crane.
It was a matter of everlasting regret to Lydia that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
this sensational progress should have taken place some
twenty years before her own arrival into the world.
In front of the empty grate stood a faded worked
screen, its spiral legs embedded in the fluffy black
hearth-rug.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Lydia, suddenly reminded, “where is
Shamrock?”</p>

<p>“Out, I suppose,” said Uncle George simply. Shamrock was
Grandpapa’s dog, and Uncle George had
good reason to disclaim all responsibility for Shamrock’s
in-comings and out-goings.</p>

<p>“A seaside town, or, in fact, any town, is no place
for a dog, in my opinion,” said Uncle George.</p>

<p>“Of course they have more fun in the country,”
glibly returned his niece, who had never spent more
than three consecutive days in the country anywhere,
nor owned a dog in her life. “They can run after
chickens and lambs, I suppose,” she added innocently.</p>

<p>“They can indeed!” ejaculated Uncle George.
“But why lambs, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d seen pictures of dogs running after
sheep, and barking at them to make them go the right
way.”</p>

<p>“Sheep-dog! That’s another matter. Sheep are
not lambs, child—nor is this the season for lambs.”</p>

<p>Uncle George looked happier, having found an
opportunity for the bestowal of information.</p>

<p>Lydia secretly thought him very like Mr. Barlow in
“Sandford and Merton,” and had no idea that her
comparison was anything but complimentary.</p>

<p>“Have you ever read ‘Sandford and Merton,’ Uncle
George?” she inquired conversationally. She had no
idea of simulating a conventional grief for her mother
with Uncle George, knowing instinctively that any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
such display would merely embarrass him. Uncle
George liked one to be intelligent and very attentive
to everything he said. Lydia had often asked him
questions, the answers to which left her profoundly
indifferent, merely for the sake of pleasing him. Her
unconsciously cynical acknowledgment to herself of
her own motives at least saved her from the charge
of insincerity.</p>

<p>Lydia had seen so little of her grandfather during
the last three years that she could not remember what
he liked from little girls, although she retained a vivid
impression, mostly gathered from her mother, that
Aunt Evelyn’s noisy, slangy, hockey-playing Beatrice
and Olive were not approved of by him.</p>

<p>Lydia, the precocious little only child of a mother
half-enviously and half-contemptuously acknowledged
to be “rather a fine lady” by the Raymonds and the
Senthovens, was not likely to transgress in the same
directions as Beatrice and Olive.</p>

<p>When Aunt Evelyn appeared at the dining-room
door with her summons, Lydia followed her demurely
upstairs. She remembered the steep, rather narrow
staircase, with a blue carpet that gave place abruptly
on the second flight to yellow oilcloth, and the ugly
blue paper on the walls, quite well.</p>

<p>The drawing-room seemed altogether strange to
her, but she was given no time to examine it.</p>

<p>“Here is little Lydia, Grandpapa,” said Aunt Beryl,
who stood as though on guard behind the arm-chair
in the bow window, that looked out on to a distant
strip of grey sea.</p>

<p>How <i>tiny</i> Grandpapa was!</p>

<p>It quite shocked Lydia to see the minute proportions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of the stiff little figure that sat back rigidly in
the depths of the arm-chair.</p>

<p>Grandpapa’s hand was like a claw, and his eyes
looked out of a network of wrinkles such as Lydia
had never seen or imagined on a human countenance.</p>

<p>She half expected his voice to be in proportion, but
it was in very sharp, incisive tones that he addressed
her:</p>

<p>“How d’y do, my dear? You are very young to
know grief.”</p>

<p>“Lydia has been very good and brave, and given us
no trouble at all, Grandpapa,” said Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>“That’s right. That’s quite right. How old are
you, Lyddie?”</p>

<p>Lydia suddenly remembered that her grandfather
had always called her “Lyddie,” although no one else
ever did so.</p>

<p>“Twelve and a half, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“Can you read?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Lydia, astonished.</p>

<p>“There is reading <i>and</i> reading,” said the old man
rather grimly. “If yours is very good you can read
to me in the mornings, and save your Aunt Beryl.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to see about some lessons for her
in the mornings,” said Aunt Beryl rather repressively.</p>

<p>“Eh, what’s that? You don’t want to go to school,
do you, my dear?”</p>

<p>Lydia wanted to go to school very much, and had
always resented her mother’s refusal to send her there,
and the irregular, desultory lessons at home, from
which she knew that she learnt nothing useful.</p>

<p>But already she felt certain that to say so would not
advance her cause with Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“I have never been to school,” she said at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“A very good thing too. I don’t like all this business
of girls trying to be like boys, and learning all sorts
of rough ways.”</p>

<p>Old Raymond cast a malicious glance at his daughter
Evelyn, whose two girls attended a high school.</p>

<p>“You’re tired, Grandpapa,” she said gently and unresentfully,
although she coloured.</p>

<p>“What made you sit in the drawing-room to-day?”
asked Aunt Beryl. “You know you always stay in the
dining-room until six o’clock.”</p>

<p>Grandpapa’s perfectly alert old face suddenly assumed
a blank expression.</p>

<p>“Eh, my dear?” he said vacantly.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl repeated the observation in a higher key.</p>

<p>“I can’t hear you,” said Grandpapa obstinately.</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn and Aunt Beryl exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, my dears, it’s very ill-bred. Even
little Lyddie here can tell you that. Very bad manners
to exchange glances. I suppose you thought I
couldn’t see you, but I’ve got very good eyes yet.”</p>

<p>The old man chuckled gaily at the discomfiture on
the faces of the two women.</p>

<p>“You must come downstairs now, Grandpapa. It’s
tea-time,” said Aunt Beryl firmly.</p>

<p>Lydia wondered how anyone so very old and frail
could ever be taken downstairs. Did Uncle George
carry him? She saw with horror that neither of her
aunts made any move to assist him as he leant forward
and gripped a stout stick that stood against the
arm-chair.</p>

<p>Then he began to slide down the seat of the deep
chair, his old frame quite rigid, one hand clutching
the arm of the chair, the other the stick.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Lydia involuntarily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Grandpapa, his face tense and his breathing very
loud, never looked at her, but both the aunts said,
“Hush!”</p>

<p>So she stood quite silent, very much interested and
rather frightened, while the tiny, taut old frame
twisted itself to the perpendicular, and at last stood
erect. Then, and then only, Grandpapa accepted the
support of Aunt Beryl’s arm to supplement that of the
stick as he went very, very slowly downstairs, one step
at a time.</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn, following behind with Lydia, explained
to her that Grandpapa never allowed anyone
to help him out of his chair.</p>

<p>“You will learn all the little ways of the house in
time,” said Aunt Evelyn kindly. “You know we hope
that this is to be your home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, auntie,” said Lydia submissively.</p>

<p>A dim, resentful consciousness was slowly creeping
over her that “to learn all the little ways of the house”
is the endless and often uncongenial concomitant to
that orphaned state to which she had proudly laid
claim.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not difficult to learn the routine of life at
Regency Terrace. By the end of the autumn Lydia
felt as though she had always lived there.</p>

<p>It was very monotonous.</p>

<p>Breakfast was at eight o’clock, and Lydia found
herself expected to partake of bread-and-milk, to
which she was not accustomed, and which rather annoyed
her because she knew they only gave it to her
in order to satisfy Grandpapa’s old-fashioned sense
of the appropriate.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast she went out, so as to
give Aunt Beryl time to see to the housekeeping before
her lessons.</p>

<p>“A good brisk walk up and down the Front,” her
aunt said encouragingly. “There are never many
people there early.”</p>

<p>After September, indeed, there were hardly ever
any people there at all.</p>

<p>Lydia did not dislike her solitary promenades from
one end of the Esplanade to the other, except on the
days when there was an east wind, when she hated it.</p>

<p>At first she was allowed to take Grandpapa’s dog,
Shamrock, with her, although with many misgivings
on the part of Aunt Beryl. Shamrock was reputedly
a Sealyham terrier, and Grandpapa was inordinately
attached to him. He roared with laughter when Uncle
George said angrily that the dog made a fool of him
by flattening himself under the front wheel of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
bicycle which daily conveyed Uncle George to his
office; and when Shamrock made all Regency Terrace
hideous with howls, on the few occasions that Uncle
George kicked him out of the way, Grandpapa’s deafness
immediately assailed him in its most pronounced
form, and he assured his daughter that he could hear
nothing at all, and that it was all her fancy.</p>

<p>“Good little dog, Shamrock,” said Grandpapa approvingly,
when Shamrock prostrated himself in an
attitude of maudlin affection before the old man’s arm-chair,
as he invariably did, to the disgust of the household.</p>

<p>He also showed himself scrupulously obedient to
Grandpapa’s lightest word, although unfortunate Aunt
Beryl might still be hoarse from prolonged cries at
the hall-door in a vain endeavour to defend the bare
legs of hapless little passing children, whom Shamrock
took a delight in terrifying, although he never hurt
them.</p>

<p>Lydia liked Shamrock because he always pranced
along so gaily, and wagged his tail so effusively, and
also because she suspected him of more than sharing
her dislike of the parrot.</p>

<p>But their walks together were not a success. There
was only one crossing, but Shamrock always contrived
to negotiate it as badly as possible under an advancing
tram, thus causing the driver to shout angrily at Lydia.
He would simulate sudden, delighted recognitions of
invalid old ladies in bath-chairs, and hurl himself upon
them with extravagant demonstrations, until the bath-chair
men, to most of whom he was only too well
known, would seize him by the scruff of the neck and
hurl him away.</p>

<p>Finally, as he never entered the house when Lydia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>did, but invariably contrived to give her the slip and
extended the excursion by himself, Aunt Beryl no
longer allowed her to take him out. Lydia was sorry,
but she made no lamentations. If one lived with
people, it was always better to conform to their wishes,
she had long ago discovered. Her innate philosophy
waxed with the disproportionate rapidity sometimes
seen in children who are dependent on other than their
natural surroundings, for a home.</p>

<p>Crudely put, she conformed to each environment in
which she found herself, but—and in this, Lydia, without
knowing it, was exceptional—she never lost a
particle of her own strong individuality. She merely
waited, quite unconsciously, for an opportunity when
it might expediently be set free.</p>

<p>With Aunt Beryl she was a docile, rather silent
little girl. Aunt Beryl gave her lessons every morning
from “Little Arthur”, and set her arithmetic problems
of which Lydia knew very well that she did not herself
know the workings, and to which she merely looked up
the answers in a key, and also made her practise scales
upon the piano in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“It will make your fingers nice and supple, even if
one or two of the keys won’t sound,” said Aunt Beryl.
“I’ll write a note to the piano tuner next week.”</p>

<p>But she never did.</p>

<p>Lydia thought gloomily that she was learning even
less now than in the old days in London, when her
mother had, at least, taught her scraps of French, and
given her innumerable books to read. Aunt Beryl
declared that Lydia could go on with French by herself,
and a French grammar was bought.</p>

<p>“I’ll hear you say your verbs,” said Aunt Beryl,
harassed, “but I’ve forgotten my accent long ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>As for books, there were none in the Regency Terrace
house. When Aunt Beryl wanted to read, she
had recourse to <i>Weldon’s Fashion Journal</i>, or to an
occasional <i>Home Chat</i>. Grandpapa had the daily
paper read to him, but her aunt once told Lydia that
“Grandpapa used to be a great reader, but he can’t
see now without glasses, and he won’t use them. So
he never reads.”</p>

<p>Uncle George, indeed, often brought home a book
from the Public Library in the evenings, but he did
not offer to lend them to Lydia, neither did such titles
attract her as “Goodman’s Applied Mechanics,” or
somebody else’s “Theory of Heat, Light, and Sound”.
Aunt Beryl, however, was kind, and when Lydia had
once said that she liked reading, she promised her a
story-book for Christmas. It was then October.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she taught her needlework, and Lydia
learnt to make her own blouses, and to knit woollen
underwear for a necessitous class vaguely designated
by Aunt Beryl as “the pore”.</p>

<p>Sewing was the only thing that Aunt Beryl taught
Lydia in such a way as to make it interesting. She
had no lessons after dinner, which was in the middle
of the day. Sometimes in the afternoon she walked
slowly on the Esplanade with Aunt Beryl beside Grandpapa’s
chair, but more often, as the weather grew
colder, she and Aunt Beryl went out alone, and then
they walked briskly into what Aunt Beryl called “the
town”. The part where Regency Terrace stood was
the “residential quarter”.</p>

<p>“The town” mainly consisted of King Street and
one of those tributary streets where the shops were.
Lydia rather liked the shopping expeditions with Aunt
Beryl, and felt important when the grocer’s boy or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the ironmonger’s young lady took an order, and said,
“Yes, Miss Raymond. Good afternoon, Miss Raymond,”
without asking for any address.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Aunt Beryl’s list was a long one,
and the darkness of approaching winter fell early, she
took Lydia in to have tea at a small establishment
known to King Street as the “Dorothy Cayfe,” and
the shopping was resumed afterwards, in the cheerful
light of the prevalent gas. This happened seldom, however,
as Aunt Beryl liked to be at home, in order to give
Grandpapa his tea—which was not wonderful, since
whenever she failed to do so her parent never omitted
to make caustic allusion to the “long outing that she
must have been enjoying in the good fresh air.”</p>

<p>When Aunt Beryl had duly been present at the rite
of tea, however, it was an understood thing that she
went out for a couple of hours afterwards, and left
Lydia to entertain Grandpapa. “I am just going to
step round to the Jacksons, dear, with my work. I’ll
be back by six o’clock or so.” That was really the time
that Lydia liked best.</p>

<p>She soon found out that with Grandpapa she might
be her own shrewd, little cynical self. He only required
outward decorum and an absence of any modern slang
or noisiness, which accorded well with Lydia’s natural
taste and early training.</p>

<p>She also speedily discovered that Grandpapa thought
her clever and that so long as her opinions and judgments
were her own, he was ready to listen to them with
amusement and interest. Any affectation or insincerity
he would pounce upon in a moment. “Don’t humbug,”
he sometimes said sharply. “It’s the worst policy in
the world. Humbug always ends in muddle.”</p>

<p>“Shamrock’s a humbug,” said the old man once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
chuckling as he fondled the little white dog. “He’s a
humbug and he’ll come to a bad end. When I’m dead,
they’ll get rid of Shamrock. They think I’m taken in
by his humbug, but I know he’s a bad dog.”</p>

<p>Lydia could not help thinking that “they” had some
excuse in supposing Grandpapa to be blind and deaf to
his protégé’s iniquities, but she put out her hand and
patted the dog’s rough head.</p>

<p>“Would you look after Shamrock, Lyddie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa, I am very fond of him.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Grandpapa sharply.</p>

<p>“Because he amuses me,” answered Lydia truthfully.</p>

<p>“Ah ha! we all find it amusing to see other people
being made fools of!” was Grandpapa’s charitable sentiment.
“Well, you shall have him one of these days,
Lyddie. I hope you’ll have a good home to give him.
What do you mean to do when you’re grown up?”</p>

<p>“Write books,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>To Aunt Beryl she would have said, “Get married
and have two boys and a little girl, auntie”—but her
Aunt Beryl would never have dreamt of asking her
this question.</p>

<p>“Heigh?” said Grandpapa, in a rather astonished
voice.</p>

<p>“Write books.”</p>

<p>“A blue stocking never gets a husband,” said Grandpapa
sententiously.</p>

<p>Lydia did not know what a blue stocking was, although
she deduced that it was no compliment to be
called one, but she was too proud to ask.</p>

<p>“What sort of books do you want to write?”</p>

<p>“Stories,” said Lydia, “and perhaps poetry.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever tried?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“One of these days,” said Grandpapa, with cautious
vagueness, “you may read me one of your stories, and
we shall see what we shall see; but you mustn’t expect
to make a living by writing books, Lyddie. That’s a
thing that’s only done by hard work.”</p>

<p>“What sort of hard work?”</p>

<p>“There’s very little hard work that women are fit
for. They can go governessing, or school teaching, or
nurse in hospitals. Your Aunt Beryl had a fancy that
way once, but I told her she’d get as much nursing as
she wanted at home, all in good time, and you see I
was quite right.”</p>

<p>“Did Aunt Evelyn want to do something, too?”</p>

<p>“She wanted to get married, my dear, and so she
took the first young fellow that came after her. Never
you do that, Lyddie.”</p>

<p>Lydia raised surprised eyes to the old man’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Grandpapa soothingly, “you’ve
got twice the brains of any of them, we know that.
You get them from your mother. Not that brains
ever did her any good, poor soul—she was unbalanced,
as clever women generally are.”</p>

<p>“Am I unbalanced, Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“Now that’s a bad habit,” said Grandpapa, suddenly
extending a gnarled forefinger like a little twisted bit
of old ivory, as though about to lay it on some objectionable
insect. “That’s a very bad habit, Lyddie, me
dear. Don’t refer everything back to yourself. It
bores people. Do it in your own mind,” said Grandpapa,
chuckling; “no doubt you won’t be able to help
it—but not out loud. When someone tells you that
Mrs. Smith dresses better than she walks, don’t immediately
go and say, like nine women out of every
ten, ‘Do I dress better than I walk?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Grandpapa assumed a piping falsetto designed to
simulate a feminine voice: “And don’t say, either, ‘Oh,
that reminds me of what was said about <i>me</i> this time
nine years ago.’ People don’t want to hear about
you—they want to hear about themselves.”</p>

<p>“Always, Grandpapa?” said Lydia, dismayed.</p>

<p>“Practically always, and when you’ve grasped that,
you’ve got the secret of success. <i>Always let the other
people talk about themselves.</i>”</p>

<p>Lydia’s memory was a retentive one, and to the end
of her life, at the oddest, most unexpected moments,
Grandpapa’s aphorism, delivered in the very tones of
his cracked, sardonic old voice, was destined to return
to her, always with increased appreciation of its cynical
penetration into the weakness of human nature:</p>

<p>“<i>Always let the other people talk about themselves.</i>”</p>

<p>With the advent of Aunt Beryl and the lamp, needless
to say, Grandpapa ceased imparting these educational
items to Lydia.</p>

<p>He listened to Aunt Beryl’s account of Mrs. Jackson’s
asthma, agreed that Uncle George was late back
from the office, and became deaf and vacant-eyed when
Aunt Beryl reproachfully said that Shamrock had
brought a live crab into the front hall, and upset the
girl’s temper. At seven o’clock, Aunt Beryl and Lydia
went away to don evening blouses, and, in the case of
Aunt Beryl, a “dressy” black silk skirt, and half an
hour later they all had supper in the dining-room.</p>

<p>Once a week, Wednesdays, Mr. Monteagle Almond,
from the Bank, used to come in at nine o’clock and play
chess with Uncle George. He told Lydia once that
he had never missed a Wednesday evening, except
when either or both were away, during the last fifteen
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“And I don’t suppose,” solemnly said Mr. Almond,
“I shall miss one for the next fifteen—not if we’re
both spared.”</p>

<p>He was a dried-up-looking little man, with a thin
beard and a nearly bald head, and both Uncle George
and Aunt Beryl chaffed him facetiously from time to
time on the subject of getting married, but Mr. Monteagle
Almond never retaliated by turning the tables
on them, as Lydia privately considered that he might
well have done.</p>

<p>On the evenings when Mr. Almond was not present,
Aunt Beryl very often took off her shoes and rested
her feet, which were always causing her pain, against
the rung of a chair. Sometimes, when Gertrude had
cleared away, she hung over the dining-room table,
spread with paper patterns and rolls of material, and
after hovering undecidedly for a long while, would suddenly
pounce on her largest pair of scissors and begin to
slash away with every appearance of recklessness. But
the recklessness was always justified when the dress or
the blouse was finished. She was never too much absorbed
to remember Lydia’s bedtime, however, and at
nine o’clock every night Lydia was expected to rouse
Grandpapa from the light slumber into which he would
never admit that he had fallen, Uncle George from the
newspaper or “Applied Mechanics,” and shake hands
with them gravely as she said good night.</p>

<p>Only the game of chess might not be interrupted.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl always came up to say good night to
Lydia in her nice little room at the top of the house.</p>

<p>“Sure you’re quite warm enough, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite, thank you, auntie.”</p>

<p>“There’s another blanket whenever you want one.
You’ve only to say. Have you said your prayers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And brushed your teeth?”</p>

<p>“Yes, auntie.”</p>

<p>“Good night, dearie. Sleep well.”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl tucked her up and kissed her, and sometimes
she said: “Sleep on your back and tuck in the
clothes, and then the fleas won’t bite your toes.”</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs again, and Lydia never
heard her and Uncle George going up to bed, for
Grandpapa always refused to stir before twelve o’clock,
and sometimes later, and it was necessary that both
of them should wait so as to keep him company and
eventually take him up to his room. The only variety
in the week was Sunday, and even Sundays had their
own routine. A later breakfast and a morning in
church were succeeded by a heavy midday meal and a
somnolent afternoon for Aunt Beryl and Grandpapa.
Uncle George very often took Lydia for a long walk,
in the course of which he became more than ever like
Mr. Barlow, and would suddenly, while crossing the
railway bridge, propound such inquiries as:</p>

<p>“Now, what do you suppose is meant by the word
<i>Tare</i>, on the left-hand bottom corner of those trucks?”</p>

<p>Lydia very seldom knew the answer to these conundrums,
but whether she did or no, she was sufficiently
aware that no scientific precision of reply on her part
would have given her uncle half the satisfaction that
it did to enlighten her ignorance. Accordingly, she
generally said demurely:</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered, Uncle George. I should like
to know what it means.”</p>

<p>She always listened to Uncle George’s accurate and
painstaking explanations and tried to remember them.
Suspecting extraordinary deficiencies in Aunt Beryl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
system of education, she was genuinely desirous of
supplementing them whenever she could.</p>

<p>Her ambitions to acquire learning, accomplishments,
and the achievement of extreme personal beauty, all
of which seemed to her to be equally far from realization,
were Lydia’s only troubles at Regency Terrace.</p>

<p>On the former questions she had determined to approach
either her uncle or her grandfather after Christmas.
Not before, Lydia shrewly decided, or they
would say that she was in too great a hurry, that she
had not yet had a fair trial of the system of regular
lessons at home. In foresight and appraisement of
valuation where the touchstone of what she considered
to be her own best interest was concerned, Lydia’s
judgment and calm, unchildlike tenacity of purpose
might have been envied by a financier. But to the
question of her own appearance, she brought all the
ridiculous finality, childish vanity and exaggeration, of
twelve-year-old femininity. She spent a long time in
front of her small looking-glass, almost every day,
staring at her little pointed face, seeking desperately
for traces of beauty in her olive skin and straight brows
and wishing that her eyes were blue, or brown, or even
grey—anything except a dark, variable sort of hazel.
The only satisfaction she got was from the contemplation
of her hair, which was long and dark and very
thick. Aunt Beryl made her wear it in two plaits, during
the day-time, but Lydia did not dislike this; as the
plaits undone and carefully brushed out in the evenings,
gave a momentary wave to the perfectly straight mass.</p>

<p>Lydia brushed it off her forehead and fastened it
back with a round comb, and thought that she looked
rather like the pictures of “Alice Through the Looking-Glass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>She was tall for her age, which was another source
of satisfaction, but the length of her slim hands and
feet were a terrible portent of inordinate future growth,
and Aunt Beryl, with a foresight unappreciated by her
niece, insisted upon a precautionary and unsightly tuck
in all Lydia’s garments.</p>

<p>But in spite of the tucks, and the frequent east wind,
and Aunt Beryl’s lessons, and the complete absence of
any society of her own age, Lydia liked Regency Terrace
very much.</p>

<p>She had an odd appreciation for the security implied
by the very monotony of each day as it slipped
by. With her mother there had been no security at all.
They had come from China when Lydia was five, and
she could only just remember a little about the voyage,
and the terrible parting from her Amah. After that,
they had been in London, sometimes at a boarding-house
sometimes in rooms, once in a big hotel where
Lydia had had her first alarming, unforgettable experience
of going up and downstairs in a lift. When
Lydia was six, and her father had gone back to China,
she and her mother had stayed first with one relation
and then with another, and none of the visits had been
very comfortable nor successful. Lydia’s mother had
cried and said that no one understood the sort of thing
she was used to in Hong Kong, and what a dreadful
change it was for her to be without a man to look
after her.</p>

<p>Lydia, a detached and solemn little girl, had retained
from those early years a dislike of scenes and tears, and
self-pitying rhapsodies, that was to remain with her
for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>They were in London when Lydia’s mother became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
a widow and the next three years had been worse than
ever.</p>

<p>Lydia was sent to stay with Aunt Evelyn, and then,
just as she was beginning to feel rather more at home
with her noisy, teasing cousins, her mother fetched her
away again and they went to rooms in Hampstead. But
the landlady there objected to the number of times that
Lydia’s mother asked her friends, although only one at
a time, to come and have supper and spend the evening.
The two ladies would sit up very late, while Lydia’s
mother talked of all that made her unhappy, and generally
cried a great deal, and very often, even after
the visitor had gone, would come and wake Lydia up
by kneeling at her bedside and sobbing there.</p>

<p>From Hampstead, her mother went as paying guest
to a family in West Kensington and Lydia was sent to
a boarding-school. She never forgot the mortification
of her mother’s sudden descent upon her, when she
had been there nearly a whole term, to say that she
had come to take her away.</p>

<p>“But she’s getting on so well!” the head mistress,
whom Lydia liked, had protested. “You’re very happy
with us, aren’t you, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Lydia had muttered miserably, and with only
too much truth.</p>

<p>She had been happier than ever before, and had
made friends with other little girls, and enjoyed the
games they played, and the interesting lessons. And
she had felt almost sure of getting a prize at the end
of the year. But she knew with a dreadful certainty
that if she showed her great reluctance to leaving
school, and her disappointment and humiliation at being
taken away without rhyme or reason, her mother
would have a fit of the tempestuous crying that Lydia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
so dreaded, and would say how heartless it was of
her little girl not to want to come home, “now that
they only had each other.” So she swallowed very
hard, and looked down on the floor, clenching her
hands, and made hardly any protest at all. Her only
comfort was that her mother’s impetuosity, which could
never wait, insisted upon her immediate departure.
And Lydia was glad to avoid any farewells, with the
astonished questions and comments that must have
accompanied them.</p>

<p>She felt that she could never bear to see the nice
Kensington school again.</p>

<p>After that she had lessons or holidays as seemed
good to her mother, and very seldom spent a consecutive
three months in the same place. No wonder that
Regency Terrace, unaltered in half a century, seemed
a very haven of refuge to Mrs. Raymond’s child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experience</span> has to be bought, generally at the cost
of some humiliating youthful mistakes. Those who
profit by these unpleasant transactions early in life may
be congratulated.</p>

<p>Lydia, the anxious diplomatist, so acutely desirous
of keeping in the good graces of those who had control
of her destiny, found that she had made a mistake in
approaching Grandpapa privately upon the momentous
subject.</p>

<p>Grandpapa, indeed, had received her carefully-thought-out
explanation with not too bad a grace.</p>

<p>“So you don’t think you’re learning enough, eh,
Lyddie? D’you think you know more than Aunt
Beryl already?”</p>

<p>Lydia had nearly cried.</p>

<p>“No, Grandpapa,” she began in the horrified accents
of outraged conventionality, when she remembered in
time Grandpapa’s uncanny faculty for penetrating to
one’s real true, inmost opinion.</p>

<p>“Not more,” she said boldly, “but I know as much
of Little Arthur’s History as there is in the book, and
auntie can’t take me any further in French or fractions,
and she never has time to give me proper music lessons
I only do scales, and Weber’s Last Valse, by
myself. And I can <i>feel</i> I’m not getting on, Grandpapa—and
I do so want to.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to earn my own living,” said Lydia, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
proud of the words, “and besides, I’m going to write
books.”</p>

<p>“Can you spell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be the first woman of my acquaintance that
could, then,” said Grandpapa unbelievingly.</p>

<p>“But there are heaps of other things I ought to
know besides spelling,” she urged.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose that’s true. But what is it you
want to do? I won’t pay for a Madame to come and
parlyvoo every day,” said Grandpapa in sarcastic allusion
to a recent flight on the part of Aunt Beryl’s
friends, the Jacksons.</p>

<p>“Would it be very expensive to let me go to school
for a little bit, Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“What, and come back a great hulking tomboy, all
muddy boots, and scratched hands like your cousins?”</p>

<p>There was less opposition than Lydia had expected
in his manner, and she began to plead eagerly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, truly I wouldn’t—I needn’t play games
at all. It’s only for the lessons I want to go. Beatrice
and Olive only like it for the hockey, they <i>hate</i> their
lessons. But I would work all the time, Grandpapa,
and bring back heaps of prizes.”</p>

<p>“Mind, if I let you go at all, it would be only as a
day boarder,” said Grandpapa warningly. But there
was more than a hint of concession in his tone.</p>

<p>“That’s all I want,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>“I’ll think it over, and talk to your aunt. Now go
and fetch me to-day’s paper.”</p>

<p>Grandpapa occasionally made a feint of reading the
newspaper to himself, although he was never seen to
turn over a page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I can’t, Grandpapa. Aunt Beryl took it away, but
she is going to bring it back this evening.”</p>

<p>“You <i>can’t</i>?” said Grandpapa in a voice that contrived
to be terrible, although it was so small and high-pitched:
“Don’t talk nonsense! There’s no such thing
as <i>can’t</i>. There’s <i>won’t</i>, if you like.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt very much distressed. Grandpapa’s anger
and contempt were not pleasant at any time, and just
now when he appeared so nearly disposed to grant her
heart’s desire, she was less than ever wishful of incurring
them.</p>

<p>“Aunt Beryl has lent the paper to Mrs. Jackson for
something,” she faltered, feeling much disposed to
cry. “She said you were sure not to want it before
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Quite wrong. I want it at once. Now don’t say
<i>can’t</i> again,” said Grandpapa sharply.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Lydia looked helplessly at her
tyrant.</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as <i>can’t</i>,” said Grandpapa
truculently. “Just you take hold of that and don’t you
ever forget it. Never place any reliance on a person
who says <i>can’t</i>. Let ’em say they won’t—or they don’t
want to—that may be true. The other isn’t. Anybody
can do anything, if they only make up their minds to
it.”</p>

<p>Grandpapa and his descendant faced one another in
silence for a minute or so across the echo of this Spartan
theory. At last the old man said contemptuously:</p>

<p>“If you haven’t learnt <i>that</i> yet, you’re not ready for
any more schooling than we can give you here, I can
tell you.”</p>

<p>It was as Lydia had feared!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The future of one’s education, the whole of one’s
career in fact, was at stake.</p>

<p>Lydia gulped at an enormous lump in her throat and
managed to articulate with sufficient determination:</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch it.”</p>

<p>Then she hurried out of the room, wondering what
on earth she should do next.</p>

<p>Rush out and buy another paper?</p>

<p>The shops were a long way off, and very likely the
morning papers might be all sold out.</p>

<p>The station book stall?</p>

<p>That again was open to the same objections.</p>

<p>Borrow one from somebody else?</p>

<p>But whom?</p>

<p>Suddenly Lydia caught her breath.</p>

<p>Why not? It seemed obvious, once one had thought
of it.</p>

<p>She hastily put on her hat, left the front door ajar
behind her, and walked out into the road and down a
street that ran at an angle to Regency Terrace.</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. Raymond would be glad to have
the morning paper back again if Mrs. Jackson has quite
finished with it,” she said politely, relieved that it was
late enough in the day for “the girl” to open the door
of the Jackson establishment to her, instead of one of
the family.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she was again confronting Grandpapa,
this time feeling triumphant and highly pleased
with herself.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it, Grandpapa!”</p>

<p>Grandpapa’s claw-like old hand shot out and
snatched at the newspaper.</p>

<p>“What’s the date on it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Lydia read it aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“That’s to-day’s all right.”</p>

<p>“I went round and asked——” began Lydia, desirous
of exploiting her resourcefulness.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, me dear. Never spoil an achievement
by a long story about it,” said Grandpapa. “I asked
for the paper and you’ve brought it. That’s quite
enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa,” said Lydia submissively.</p>

<p>Grandpapa pointed the moral no further but Lydia
had unconsciously added another paragraph to the
Book of Rules which was to guide her throughout the
mysterious game that was just beginning for her:
“There’s no such thing as can’t.”</p>

<p>She heard nothing more for the next few days of
her ambitious request to be sent to school, and was
far too cautious to risk a peremptory refusal through
importunity.</p>

<p>It was a week later that she became uncomfortably
aware of an indefinable alteration in her aunt’s manner
towards her.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter, auntie?” she gently ventured.</p>

<p>“Why should anything be the matter, dear?” said
Aunt Beryl, her lips very close together and her gaze
not meeting Lydia’s.</p>

<p>The child’s heart sank.</p>

<p>Quite obviously Aunt Beryl was offended, and
meant to adopt the trying policy of ignoring any cause
for offence. Twice she was too tired to come upstairs
and say good night to Lydia, although this had never
happened before, and several times when Lydia made
little obvious comments, of the sort that always constituted
conversation between them on their walks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Aunt Beryl appeared to be too much absorbed in
thought to have heard her.</p>

<p>“I would much rather be scolded,” reflected Lydia
dismally.</p>

<p>She was not scolded, but Aunt Beryl’s sense of
grievance presently passed into a more articulate stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask <i>me</i>, dear. I’m nobody. <i>I</i> don’t know
anything,” she suddenly exclaimed with extreme bitterness,
on a request for advice in respect of Lydia’s
knitting.</p>

<p>“Oh, auntie! are you angry?”</p>

<p>“Why should I be angry, dear? I may be <i>grieved</i>,
but that’s another matter.”</p>

<p>On this ground Aunt Beryl finally took her stand.</p>

<p>“I’m not angry, dear—I’m grieved.”</p>

<p>And grieved Aunt Beryl remained, tacitly waving
away all Lydia’s timid attempts at apology or explanation.</p>

<p>Could anything be better calculated to make one feel
thoroughly remorseful and uncomfortable?</p>

<p>Lydia, however, characteristically felt more resentful
than remorseful.</p>

<p>The tension of the situation was slightly relieved one
evening, greatly to Lydia’s surprise, by Mr. Monteagle
Almond.</p>

<p>“So you’re being sent to school, young lady?” he remarked
quietly, making Lydia jump.</p>

<p>“Oh, am I?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know. I understand that a certain
young lady, not a hundred miles away from where we
are now, asked to be sent to school, so that she might
grow very learned. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“I <i>should</i> like to go to school,” faltered Lydia.</p>

<p>“Very natural,” said Mr. Almond indulgently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
“Companions of your own age attract you, no doubt.
What would childhood be without other children, eh,
George? You remember?”</p>

<p>“I was not so well provided as you were, Monty,”
said Uncle George rather resentfully.</p>

<p>“Indeed, no. Are you aware, young lady, that I
was one of a family of fifteen?”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl made a clicking sound with her tongue.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Raymond, fifteen. My father and
mother were old-fashioned people, and held that each
child carried a blessing with it. Three died in infancy,
and a young brother was lost at sea. Otherwise
I’m thankful to say that we are all spared to this
day.”</p>

<p>“Fancy!” said Aunt Beryl in a flat voice.</p>

<p>“Fifteen children,” repeated the grey-bearded clerk,
“and my mother kept her figure to the last day of her
life. A lesson to the young wives of to-day, I often
think.”</p>

<p>“Your bedtime, Lydia,” said Aunt Beryl briskly.
“Go upstairs now and I’ll come and put the light out.”</p>

<p>Lydia was much too tactful to point out that it was
still ten minutes before her bedtime, understanding
perfectly that the indiscreetness of Mr. Monteagle
Almond’s conversation was responsible for her accelerated
departure.</p>

<p>She had learnt that she was really going to school,
and she was happy.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl gradually became reconciled to the loss
of her pupil, and presently began to show signs of
pride in Lydia’s advancement.</p>

<p>Once or twice Lydia heard her talking to Mrs. Jackson
in the rapid undertones always adopted by Aunt
Beryl and Aunt Evelyn with their friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Quite a backward child, when she came to us last
year. Between ourselves, my sister-in-law never took
much trouble.... I was quite against sending her to
Miss Glover’s at first—you know, I thought she’d be
so behind in everything. So she was, too, but the way
that child has picked up! You really wouldn’t believe
it—I’m sure half the sums in her book I couldn’t do
myself. Never was good at figures.”</p>

<p>Lydia was very proud of her faculty for arithmetic.
She thought very little of being first in her class for
English composition, and none of the other girls
thought much of it either, but they all envied her when
the weekly announcement came, as it frequently did:</p>

<p>“Problem No. 15. No one got that right except
Lydia Raymond. Stand up, Lydia Raymond, and
show the class the working of No. 15 on the black-board.
‘If a train left Glasgow at 8.45 a.m. on Wednesday,
travelling at the rate of 60 miles an hour——’”</p>

<p>Lydia enjoyed those problems, worked by herself on
the black-board in full view of half-a-dozen befogged,
pencil-chewing seniors.</p>

<p>But for her French, Lydia would have found herself
more highly placed than she was in the school.</p>

<p>Monday and Thursday afternoons.</p>

<p>O horrible verbs, O hateful <i>Première Année de
Grammaire</i>, and thrice-hateful genders!</p>

<p><i>Why</i> should a table be feminine and an arm-chair
masculine?</p>

<p>Lydia hated her French, and continued to say “Esker
le feneter de la salong ay ouvere?” in a lamentable voice
and an unalterably British accent. Very few of Miss
Glover’s girls were “good at French.” Only three
had any acquaintance with German, and of these one
was Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Many of them could play the piano correctly, and
even brilliantly, some of them could copy free-hand
drawings or plaster casts, but hardly one could write
a letter without making mistakes in spelling, punctuation,
and English. All, unconsciously enough, were
more or less defective in the correct pronunciation of
English.</p>

<p>Since brains, in Great Britain, are for the most part
the prerogative of the middle classes, it follows that
their possessors enjoy a certain prestige among their
compeers which would, on those same grounds, be
denied them in more exalted circles.</p>

<p>Lydia found that her schoolfellows were proud of
her cleverness, and disposed to seek her friendship.</p>

<p>She easily assumed leadership amongst the group of
girls of her own age who were also day boarders at
Miss Glover’s.</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> help me with this beastly sum, Lydia. I’m
sure you can do it.”</p>

<p>Lydia always acceded very graciously to such frequent
requests, partly because she loved to show her
own superior attainments, and partly because of a very
definite conviction, which she had never yet put into
words, that it was always worth while to show oneself
agreeable. In consequence of this complacence, she
was seldom at a loss for companionship in play-time.
There was always someone to walk about with, arms
round one another’s waists after the immemorial
schoolgirl practice, heads close together under black or
scarlet tam o’ shanter, for a better exchange of confidences.</p>

<p>Then Lydia put into practice Grandpapa’s Golden
Rule: <i>Always let the other people talk about themselves.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I say, Lydia, I’ll tell you a secret. Mind, now,
you’re not to say a word to anyone, because I promised
not to tell ... but I know I can trust you?”</p>

<p>An interrogative turn to that last sentence.</p>

<p>“Yes, truly you can, Ethel. Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well, promise you won’t tell. Not even if you’re
asked?”</p>

<p>“Cross my heart——” in the glib, accustomed formula.</p>

<p>“Well, then, Daisy Butcher and May Holt have had
a row. You know what <i>frightful</i> friends they’ve been
ever since the beginning of the term? Well, it’s all
over, and they’ve quarrelled. Only don’t ever say
I said so because Edith told me, and I said I wouldn’t
say because it was May Holt herself who told her,
and she made her promise not to say. I wouldn’t say
a word myself, only I really thought you <i>ought</i> to
know, sitting next to May in class and everything. I
say, do you <i>like</i> May Holt?”</p>

<p>Lydia, who thought May Holt common and stupid,
was for a moment tempted to say so. Then, innate caution
and a distrust of her companion’s garrulity restrained
her.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” she said vaguely. “I thought you
were rather friends with her?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Ethel hastily. “If the quarrel
comes out and there’s any taking sides, I shall be on
Daisy’s side. I think May Holt’s been awfully mean. I
simply can’t bear mean ways. I’m like that, you know.”</p>

<p>Thus Ethel’s confidences, similar to scores of others,
all ending in an exposition of the speaker’s view of her
own personal traits of character.</p>

<p>Storms raged in teacups, confidences were violated,
the identical Ethel who had sworn Lydia to secrecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
on the May and Daisy quarrel, found herself taxed
with various indiscreet utterances and sent to Coventry.</p>

<p>“Well, it was Edith who told me, and she said May
Holt was a liar, what’s more,” sobbed Ethel, in counter-accusation
that availed her nothing, although it raised
fresh and terrible issues between herself and Edith,
and again between Edith and May Holt, and all May
Holt’s partisans.</p>

<p>Lydia listened to it all, and thought how clever she
had been to keep clear of all this trouble.</p>

<p>It was a thing always to be remembered—the unwisdom
of uttering opinions that would probably be repeated
to their object—never, never to say anything
that could not be safely repeated without making for
one an enemy.</p>

<p>Lydia silently added this conviction to her increasing
store of worldly wisdom.</p>

<p>So she welcomed the confidences of the other girls,
most of whom seemed quite unable to prevent themselves
from talking, and she was at the same time very
careful never to render herself unpopular by mischief-making
or by carrying backwards and forwards any
of their indiscreet utterances.</p>

<p>“You can always trust Lydia,” said one or two of
the girls.</p>

<p>And once she heard one of them exclaim:</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard Lydia Raymond say an unkind
word about anybody.”</p>

<p>It sounded very sweet and charitable, but Lydia, with
a sense of humour not unlike her grandfather’s, had a
little grim, private laugh at the irony of it.</p>

<p>Several of her schoolfellows asked her to tea, or to
an occasional picnic in the summer, but Lydia very
often regretfully said that her aunt did not like her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
go out much, and declined the invitations, without ever
referring them to Aunt Beryl at all.</p>

<p>She had a fastidious idea that she did not want to be
reputed “great friends” with the children of the more
superior tradespeople, or even with the two youthful
social lights of the establishment, the daughters of a
rich local dentist.</p>

<p>Instinct, and certain recollections of her mother, led
her to seek the friendship of a quiet little girl, actually
a boarder, whose home was in the west of England,
and of whom Lydia only knew that her father was a
clergyman, and that she had nice manners and somehow
spoke differently from the others. Her name was
Nathalie Palmer.</p>

<p>Nathalie did not make so many confidences as did
the other girls, and when she did talk to Lydia it was
of Devonshire and of her own home, not of the people
at school.</p>

<p>This Lydia observed, instinctively approved, and
inwardly made note of for future imitation.</p>

<p>As Nathalie knew no one outside the school, she
was naturally unable to ask Lydia to come home with
her, but just before the midsummer break-up her father
came to visit her.</p>

<p>He stayed for two days at the Seaview Hotel, and
Nathalie took Lydia to luncheon there.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer looked old to be the father of fourteen-year-old
Nathalie, and had a slow, clerical manner of
speech that rather overawed Lydia.</p>

<p>She had never had a meal at any hotel since the days
with her mother and father in London, that seemed
now so immeasurably remote, and she felt rather nervous.
Politely answering Mr. Palmer’s kind inquiries
as to her place in class, her favourite games and lessons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
she was all the time anxiously casting surreptitious
glances at Nathalie to see how she helped herself
to the strange and numerous dishes proffered by
the waiter.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl was very particular about “table-manners,”
but at Regency Terrace there was never any such
bewildering profusion of knives and forks to perplex
one.</p>

<p>Once Lydia embarked upon the butter-dish, offered
by Mr. Palmer, with her own small knife, and then,
leaving it in the butter-dish, found only a very large
knife left beside her plate with which to spread it.</p>

<p>Shame and disaster threatened.</p>

<p>Lydia looked up, and her distressed gaze met that of
a waiter. To her own effable surprise, she made a
movement of her head that brought him deferentially
to her elbow with the required implement. Simplicity
itself!</p>

<p>Lydia inwardly decided that one need never be
frightened, in the most unaccustomed surroundings, if
only one kept one’s head and never betrayed any sense
of insecurity.</p>

<p>Next day she had the gratification of being shyly
told by Nathalie:</p>

<p>“Father said what a pretty face you had, Lydia, and
what nice manners. He was so glad I’d got such a nice
friend, and he said I might ask you whether one day
your aunt would let you come and stay with us during
the holidays.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lydia was fifteen, expectant of Honours in
her examinations, highly placed in the school, and with
a secret hope that the following term might see her
Head of the School—and that, moreover, at an unprecedently
early age—unexpected disaster overtook her.</p>

<p>The three placid years at Regency Terrace had been
so little marked by any changes that she had forgotten
that old sense of the insecurity and impermanence of
life, bred of early days with her mother, and it came
as a shock to her that anything should interfere seriously
with her schemes.</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly she fell ill.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that cough of yours, Lydia.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a cold, auntie.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to get any better. Let me see, how
long have you had it now?”</p>

<p>Lydia pretended to think that Aunt Beryl was only
talking to herself, and bent lower over her books.
She always worked at her preparation in the evenings
after supper now.</p>

<p>It was damp, chilly weather, and her cough grew
worse, although she stifled it as far as possible, and
said nothing about the pains in her back and sides.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl brought her a bottle of cough mixture
recommended by Mrs. Jackson, and Lydia put it on the
mantlepiece in her bedroom, and carefully dusted the
bottle every day, and sometimes poured away a little
of the contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>But one morning, one important morning when
there was a French lesson which it was essential that
Lydia, with whom French still remained the weakest
of links in an otherwise well-forged chain, should attend,
she found herself quite unable to go downstairs
to breakfast.</p>

<p>Her head swam, her eyes and mouth were burning,
and her legs unaccountably trembled beneath her.</p>

<p>“No such thing as <i>can’t</i>,” muttered Lydia fiercely,
repeating Grandpapa’s favourite axiom.</p>

<p>The pain in her side had increased without warning,
and suddenly gave her an unendurable stab every time
that she tried to move.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh!</i>”</p>

<p>Lydia sank back on the bed, and found herself crying
hoarsely from pain and dismay. Surely even
Grandpapa would admit the necessity for saying “can’t”
at last.</p>

<p>But Lydia did not see Grandpapa for some time after
that morning.</p>

<p>She lay in bed with a fire in the room, sometimes
suffering a great deal of pain, and sometimes in a
sort of strange, jumbled dream, when the pattern of
the wall paper turned into mysterious columns of
figures that would never add up, and French Irregular
Verbs danced across the ceiling.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl nursed her all day and sat up with her
at nights very often, and Dr. Young came to see her
every day.</p>

<p>Once he said to her:</p>

<p>“You’re a very good patient. I don’t know what
we should have done with you if you hadn’t been a
good, reasonable girl, and done everything you were
told.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Lydia was pleased.</p>

<p>“Am I very ill?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve turned the corner nicely now,” said
Dr. Young cheerfully. “But pneumonia’s no joke, and
you’ll have to be careful for a long while yet.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t I be able to go up for the examination?”</p>

<p>“Let me see—that’s about a month off. We shall
have to see about that.”</p>

<p>Dr. Young’s daughter was at Miss Glover’s school,
too, and he knew all about the terrible importance of
the examination. Nevertheless, he gave Lydia no
permission to resume her studies.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, dear, there’s plenty of time before
you, and now I’ve got some nice fruit jelly for you,”
said Aunt Beryl, and Lydia always thanked her very
gratefully and lay back against the pillow, trying all
the time to recapitulate the French verbs and the list of
Exceptions to Rules that she had been learning when
she first fell ill.</p>

<p>Except for anxiety about the examination, convalescence
was agreeable.</p>

<p>Uncle George came up to see her one day, and
brought her some grapes, and explained to her why
it was that the great pieces of ice in her glass of
barley-water did not cause it to overflow, quite in the
old Mr. Barlow manner, and once Nathalie Palmer
came by invitation and had tea with her upstairs, and
told her how sorry all the girls had been about her
illness.</p>

<p>“And you’ll miss the exam,” moaned Nathalie, “and
it seems such a shame. I know you’d have done splendidly.”</p>

<p>“What have you been having in class?” asked Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Almost all recapitulation. The only really new
thing that we’re doing is <i>Henry V.</i> for literature.”</p>

<p>That evening Lydia made Gertrude, the servant,
bring her the volume of Shakespeare from the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Her brain felt quite clear now, and her eyes no
longer hurt her when she tried to read.</p>

<p>Next day she was allowed to go downstairs for tea.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl, who looked very tired and sallow, helped
her to dress, and Uncle George came upstairs to fetch
her, and they both supported her very carefully down
the stairs and into the drawing-room, where a fire had
been lit, and a special tea laid on a little table beside
the arm-chair.</p>

<p>Grandpapa, with Shamrock prancing unrestainedly
at his feet, and the parrot, brought up from the dining-room,
hanging upside down in his cage on the centre-table,
were all waiting to welcome her.</p>

<p>“Very glad to see you down, me dear,” said Grandpapa,
shaking hands with her formally. “A nasty time
you’ve had, a very nasty time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“She’s been such a good girl, Grandpapa,” said
Aunt Beryl, raising her voice as though by a great
effort. “Dr. Young says she’s the best patient he’s
ever had.”</p>

<p>“Did you have to swallow a great deal of physic,
Lyddie? Ah, a very disagreeable thing, physic,” said
Grandpapa, who was ordered a certain draught daily,
which he was only too apt to pour away into the nearest
receptacle in the face of all Aunt Beryl’s protests.</p>

<p>“Mr. Almond asked after you on Wednesday, Lydia.
He has been quite concerned over your illness,” Uncle
George told her.</p>

<p>Lydia sat back in the arm-chair, her long plaits falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
over either shoulder, and could not help feeling
that all this attention was rather agreeable.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl’s friend, Mrs. Jackson, “stepped in,” to
ask how she felt, and to borrow a paper pattern for a
blouse, and said she had also heard from Dr. Young
and other sources what a good patient Lydia had been.</p>

<p>“And so hard on you, poor child, missing your examinations
and all.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Dr. Young will let me go,” said Lydia
wistfully: “It’s only four days, and not till next
week.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The Town Hall is well warmed, with those pipes
and all, but I don’t know. Perhaps if you could go in a
closed cab, well wrapped up.... But you’ve missed
such a lot of study, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Lydia dejectedly.</p>

<p>They were all very kind to her, and seemed to realize
the great disappointment of failing after all, or even
of putting off the examination for another year, when
one would be nearly sixteen, and no longer the youngest
candidate of all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson refused tea, and hurried away with
her paper pattern, Shamrock flying to the head of the
stairs after her, and breaking into a storm of howls,
as though in protest at her departure. Aunt Beryl
hastened distressfully after him.</p>

<p>“Hark at that!” said she unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Grandpapa put on his deafest expression.</p>

<p>“This is very trying for you, Lydia,” said Uncle
George pointedly. “It seems to go through and through
one’s head.”</p>

<p>Did Grandpapa actually throw a glance of concern
at the invalid? She could hardly believe her eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
felt more than ever how pleasant it was to be the
centre of attention.</p>

<p>And then Aunt Beryl came in again, dropped into a
chair near the door, oddly out of breath, and quietly
fainted away.</p>

<p>Gertrude had been sent for Dr. Young before they
could bring her back to consciousness again, and when
he did arrive, he and Uncle George almost carried Aunt
Beryl up to her room.</p>

<p>“Thoroughly overdone,” said Dr. Young. “Miss
Raymond has been so very unsparing of herself during
her niece’s illness—one of those unselfish people,
you know, who never think anything about themselves.
I am ashamed of myself for not seeing how near she
was to a break-down.”</p>

<p>Decidedly Aunt Beryl was the heroine of the hour.</p>

<p>Lydia was ashamed of herself for the resentment
that this turning of the tables awoke in her.</p>

<p>She went to her own room, unescorted, when the
commotion had subsided, and her supper was brought
up to her by Gertrude nearly an hour late.</p>

<p>“How is Aunt Beryl now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Gone to sleep, miss. She is wore out, after sitting
up at night, and then the nursing during the day, and
seeing to the house and the old gentleman, all just the
same as usual—and no wonder.”</p>

<p>No wonder, indeed! Everyone said the same.</p>

<p>During the two days that Aunt Beryl, by the doctor’s
orders, remained upstairs, the household in Regency
Terrace had time to realize what, in fact, was
the case—that never before had Miss Raymond been
absent from her post for more than a few hours at a
time.</p>

<p>When Mr. Monteagle Almond came in on Wednesday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
evening, full of inquiries and congratulations for
Lydia, he was hardly allowed time to formulate them.</p>

<p>“It’s my poor sister we are anxious about,” said
Uncle George, just as though Lydia had never been
ill at all.</p>

<p>“Quite knocked up with nursing,” said Grandpapa,
shaking his head. “I’ve never known Beryl take to her
bed before, and we miss her sadly downstairs.”</p>

<p>Mr. Monteagle Almond was deeply concerned.</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me. This is very distressing news.
I had no idea of this. Miss Raymond never complains.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Uncle George gloomily. “One
somehow never thought of her overdoing it.”</p>

<p>“Unselfish,” said Mr. Almond, adding thoughtfully:
“Well, well, well, selfish people have the best of it in
this world, there’s no doubt.”</p>

<p>The little bank clerk was generalizing, according to
his fashion, but Lydia felt angry and uncomfortable,
as though the reference might have application to
herself.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl certainly looked much as usual when she
reappeared downstairs, but it was very evident that two
days without her had thoroughly awakened both Grandpapa
and Uncle George to a new sense of her importance.</p>

<p>“We must try and spare your aunt as much as possible,”
Uncle George said gravely to Lydia. “I’m
afraid that we’ve all been allowing her to do far too
much for us.”</p>

<p>Lydia found it curiously disagreeable to see the
focus of general interest thus shifted. Unconsciously,
she had occupied the centre place in the little group
in Regency Terrace ever since her arrival there, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
twelve-year-old orphan, in her pathetic black frock.
Without consciously posing, she had certainly, as the
eager student at Miss Glover’s bringing back prizes
and commendations, been the most striking personality
of that small world, and she had known that her elders
discussed her cleverness, her steady industry, even her
increasing prettiness, as topics of paramount interest.</p>

<p>Lydia, in other words, was complacently aware of
being the heroine of that story, which is the aspect
worn by life to the imaginative. Now it appeared that
this rôle had been summarily usurped by Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>Lydia’s sense of drama was far too keen for her to
undervalue the possibilities of the aspect presented by
her aunt. It <i>was</i> pathetic to have toiled, without appreciation,
all these years, to have nursed one’s niece devotedly
day and night, and then to faint away helplessly
without a word of complaint. But the more Lydia
realized how pathetic it was, the more annoyed she
became.</p>

<p>Her own convalescence was a very rapid one, partly
owing to her determination to get to the Town Hall
for the examination. Both Grandpapa and Uncle
George, with the masculine inability to entertain more
than one anxiety at a time, appeared to have forgotten
that she had ever been ill, and Dr. Young himself,
when applied to, only said:</p>

<p>“Well, well, if you’ve really set your mind on it—the
weather’s nice and warm. But you must wrap
up well and keep out of draughts. We don’t want a
relapse, mind. Miss Raymond can’t do any more
nursing, you know. She ought to be nursed herself.”</p>

<p>Lydia would cheerfully have nursed Aunt Beryl, if
only to retain her own sense of self-importance, but
well did she know that her aunt would give her no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
such opportunity. Really, unselfish people could be
very trying.</p>

<p>She went to the Town Hall, and was greatly restored
by the enthusiastic greetings of her fellow-candidates.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lydia, how plucky of you to try, after all!
Don’t you feel <i>fearfully</i> behindhand? Fancy, if you do
get through! It’ll be even more splendid than if you
hadn’t been ill, and had no disadvantage of missing
such a lot.”</p>

<p>Lydia had a shrewd suspicion that she had not
missed nearly so much as they all thought. Nathalie
had said that most of the work done in class during
her absence had been recapitulation, and recapitulation,
to Lydia’s sound memory and habits of accuracy
inculcated by Uncle George, had never been more than
a pleasant form of making assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>For the last two days she had been studying frantically,
and had made Nathalie go through <i>Henry V.</i>
with her, and mark the passages to be learnt by heart.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured her in causing the English Literature
paper to be set for the last day of the examination.</p>

<p>When that last day came Lydia felt tolerably certain
that she had thoroughly overtaxed her barely-restored
strength, and would shortly suffer for it with some
severity, but her examination-papers had been a series
of inward triumphs.</p>

<p>French had certainly presented its usual stumbling-blocks,
but Lydia reasonably told herself that she
would probably have experienced at least equivalent
difficulties, had she attended every class, and where
mechanical rote-learning could avail her, she knew
that she was safe. Moreover, the algebra and arithmetic
papers, over which most of the candidates were
groaning, she could view with peculiar complacency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“How did you get on?” several of the girls asked
her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not <i>too</i> badly, I hope,” said Lydia guardedly.</p>

<p>It would be far more of a triumph, if she did succeed,
for her success to come as a surprise to everyone.
They could hardly expect it, after such an absence
from class as hers had been.</p>

<p>Even the governess in charge of the group of girls
said to her kindly:</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be disappointed if you don’t get
through this time, dear. Miss Glover knows you’ve
worked very well, and that it’s only illness that’s
thrown you back.”</p>

<p>Lydia returned to Regency Terrace thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ve done your best, dear, and if it isn’t
this time, it’ll be next,” said Aunt Beryl philosophically.
“Now go straight upstairs and have a good rest.”</p>

<p>Lydia went, and was not at all displeased to find that
her head was throbbing and her face colourless.</p>

<p>The following day the doctor saw her, and shook his
head at her.</p>

<p>“Better give her a change of air, Miss Raymond.
If you won’t go away yourself, it will, anyway, set
you rather more free not to have Miss Lydia on your
mind.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt that the advice might have been worded
in a manner more flattering to herself, but she was
pleased at the idea of a change.</p>

<p>She had not been away since her first arrival as an
inmate of Grandpapa’s household. Aunt Beryl’s theory
was that one went away <i>to</i> the sea, not <i>from</i> it.
If one happened to live by the sea, there was no need
to go away at all. Only Uncle George, taking his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
fortnightly holiday in the summer, departed on a walking
or bicycling tour with some bachelor friend of
his own.</p>

<p>“You’ll enjoy staying with your Aunt Evelyn,”
said Aunt Beryl. “The girls must be nearly grown up
now, I declare. How time flies! Beatrice must be all
of eighteen, and Olive sixteen, and I suppose Bob is
somewhere between the two of them. How long is it
since you’ve seen them, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“Not since I was quite little—about ten, I think.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be nice for you to make friends with the girls.
I’ve often wished you had a sister.”</p>

<p>Lydia did not echo the wish when she had seen the
Senthoven family circle.</p>

<p>“There’s no nonsense about <i>us</i>,” might have been
taken for their motto, or even their war-cry.</p>

<p>On the evening of Lydia’s arrival she was mysteriously
taken possession of by Olive, her youngest cousin,
under pretext of unpacking.</p>

<p>“I say, Lydia.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“<i>Yes?</i>” mimicked Olive, with a screwed-up mouth
and mincing pronunciation, in derisive mockery of
Lydia’s low, clear enunciation, which was in part
natural, and in part learnt from Nathalie Palmer.</p>

<p>“I declare you’re afraid of the sound of your own
voice. You ought to hear <i>us</i>! My word! we’ll make
you open your eyes—<i>and</i> ears too—before we’ve done
with you. You should just hear the ragging that goes
on whenever Bob’s at home. Look here, this is what
I want to know.”</p>

<p>This time Lydia only looked interrogation. She
despised Olive too thoroughly to care whether she
laughed at her way of speaking or not, but she thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that the sooner Olive satisfied her curiosity and went
away the better.</p>

<p>“Do you like <i>fun</i>?” said Miss Senthoven, bringing
her prominent brown eyes and head of untidy, flopping
hair close to Lydia’s face in her extreme eagerness for
a reply.</p>

<p>Lydia, when she had recovered from her surprise at
the form of the inquiry, assented, since assent was
obviously expected of her, but she had grave doubts
as to whether her own definition of “fun” would
coincide with that of the Senthovens.</p>

<p>It did not.</p>

<p>“Fun” was synonymous with noise, and the most
brilliant repartee known to any Senthoven was Bob’s
favourite form of squashing such “nonsense” as a
comment on the blueness of the sky: “Well, you didn’t
expect to see it red, did you?”</p>

<p>Bob, a hobble-de-hoy of seventeen, short and thick-set,
was his mother’s idol. But there was “no nonsense”
allowed from poor Aunt Evelyn by her terrible
daughters.</p>

<p>“The mater’s so mushy,” they shouted disgustedly,
when she made excuse, on the morning after Lydia’s
arrival, for Bob’s very tardy appearance.</p>

<p>Lydia looked round the breakfast-table. She was
quite well again now, and breakfast upstairs would
have been unheard of. Beatrice was a still larger,
taller, more athletic, and, if possible, noisier edition
of Olive. She had just left school, and her dark hair,
very thick and heavy, was piled into untidy heaps at the
back of her head.</p>

<p>“No nonsense about <i>my</i> hair, I can tell you. Half
the time I don’t even look in the glass to see how I’ve
done it,” Beatrice would declare proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The girls wore flannel shirts, with collars and ties,
and short skirts that invariably contrived to be rather
longer at the back than they were in the front.</p>

<p>They strenuously refused to make any change of
toilette in the evenings, only substituting heelless
strapped black shoes for their large and sturdy boots,
over their thick-ribbed stockings.</p>

<p>Those evenings were the noisiest that Lydia had
ever known.</p>

<p>Only Uncle Robert, small, and sallow, and spectacled,
was silent.</p>

<p>He sat at the foot of the table, said a brief, muttered
grace, and dispensed the soup.</p>

<p>“I say, what tommy-rot it is your not playing
hockey, Lydie. Bee and I have got a match on to-morrow
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I come and watch you play?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. <i>I</i> don’t care if you do, I’m sure,”
Olive hastily repudiated the mere suggestion of such
a dangerous approach to “nonsense” as was implied by
a possible interest in another’s movements.</p>

<p>“I say, I do believe Bob gets later every blessed day.
A nice row there’d be if <i>we</i> came in late for every
meal!”</p>

<p>“Too bally hungry to do that!”</p>

<p>“Your brother doesn’t get much fresh air. You
must remember he’s in an office all day, and has two
stuffy train journeys, poor boy,” said Bob’s mother
unwisely.</p>

<p>“<i>Ow!</i> poor ’ickle sing, then—mammy’s own baby-boy!”
yelled Beatrice derisively.</p>

<p>“Mater!” said Olive, “how <i>can</i> you be so sloppy?”</p>

<p>Lydia looked round her, amazed. No one seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
think, however, that Beatrice and Olive were behaving
otherwise than well and dutiful.</p>

<p>“Beef, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please, Uncle Robert.”</p>

<p>Lydia saw Beatrice wink at Olive, and Olive stuff
a corner of her Japanese paper napkin into her mouth,
as though to prevent an explosion of laughter. She
only perceived that the jest lay in the manner of her
own reply, when to the same inquiry her cousins successively
answered, very loudly and curtly.</p>

<p>“Ra-<i>ther</i>!”</p>

<p>After the beef Aunt Evelyn helped the pudding.
There were two dishes in front of her, one containing
the remaining half of the pink mould that had figured
on the dinner-table in the middle of the day, and the
other the cold remnants of the previous night’s tart.</p>

<p>And Lydia, invited to make her choice, replied very
clearly and rather defiantly:</p>

<p>“I should like some tart, if you please, Aunt Evelyn.”</p>

<p>Bob, who had made his entry with the second course,
roared with laughter, and, reaching across his sister
Beatrice, banged Lydia heavily on the back.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Lady Clara Vere de Vere. You stick
to it!”</p>

<p>Lydia, who hated being touched, jumped in her place,
but she had the wit to guess that the surest way of
making her cousins pursue any particular course of
action would be to show that she disliked it, in which
case they would instantly look upon her as “fair game.”
She did not in the least mind the series of witticisms,
lasting the length of her visit, designed to emphasize
what the Senthovens considered the affectations of her
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Just the weeniest little tiny bit, if you will be so
awf’ly kind, please. Thank you so awf’ly much.”</p>

<p>Thus Beatrice, humorously.</p>

<p>And Bob:</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps—if you were to press me to a
jelly——”</p>

<p>Lydia was not in the least amused at these sallies,
but she laughed at them cheerfully enough. She felt
immeasurably superior to the Senthovens, and had
every intention of proving that superiority to them before
the end of her stay.</p>

<p>At first blush, this did not appear to be any too easy.
There was no doubt that the Senthovens, the girls especially,
were efficient in their own line of action.</p>

<p>Beatrice was a renowned hockey captain; Olive had
silver trophies from both the Golf Club and the Swimming
Club, and both had won Junior Championships
at lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>“Are you a good walker, old girl?” Beatrice one
day inquired of Lydia.</p>

<p>This last term of endearment was a sign of the highest
goodwill, and if employed too frequently would almost
certainly lead to the accusation of sloppiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Lydia, thinking of the school crocodile
wending its decorous way the length of the Parade.</p>

<p>“Good. Olive’s an awful rotter at walking. You
and I can do some tramps together. Are you game
for a six o’clock start to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>Lydia laughed, really supposing the suggestion to
be humorously intended.</p>

<p>“What are you cackling about? You’re such an
extraordinary kid; you always seem to laugh with your
mouth shut. I suppose they taught you that at this
precious school of yours, where you don’t even play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
hockey. Well, what about to-morrow? We can take
some sort of fodder with us, but I’ve got to be back
at the Common at ten sharp for a hockey practice.”</p>

<p>Lydia was obliged to resign her pretensions. She
hadn’t understood quite what Beatrice meant by a
“good walker.”</p>

<p>“Anything up to twenty-five miles is my mark,”
said Beatrice complacently.</p>

<p>She and Olive were both good-humouredly contemptuous
of Lydia’s incapabilities, and Bob was even ready
to show her how to serve at tennis, and how to throw
a ball straight. Lydia was willing to be taught, and
was sufficiently conscious that her tennis was improving
rapidly, to submit to a good deal of shouting and
slangy, good-humoured abuse.</p>

<p>She did not like it, but was philosophically aware
that her stay at Wimbledon was drawing to a close,
and that she would reap the benefit of improved tennis
for ever afterwards.</p>

<p>“I suppose, being a duffer at games, that you’re a
regular Smart Aleck at lessons, aren’t you?” Olive
amiably asked her.</p>

<p>An assent would certainly be regarded as “bucking,”
but, on the other hand, Lydia had no mind to let her
claims to distinction be passed over.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been in for an examination,” she said
boldly. “I might hear the result any day now.”</p>

<p>“Get on! I thought you’d been ill.”</p>

<p>“I’ve missed half the term at school, but I studied
by myself, and I was up in time to go to the Town
Hall for the exam. I had to go to bed again afterwards,
though.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you’ve got an earthly?” said
Beatrice, in highly sceptical accents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Oh, I don’t know. You see, I was the youngest
competitor of all, as it happened.”</p>

<p>Lydia had been very anxious to introduce this last
piece of information, and it was plain that Beatrice and
Olive were not altogether unimpressed by it.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl had promised Lydia a telegram as soon
as the results of the examination were put up in the
Town Hall, and Lydia had already decided that in the
event of failure, she should say nothing at all to the
Senthovens. They would never remember to ask her
about it. But if she had passed, she told herself
grimly, they would have to acknowledge that they were
not the only people who could succeed. Lydia reflected
that she was sick of hearing how Olive had just
saved a goal, and Beatrice had conducted her team to
victory in yet another hockey match.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last of Lydia’s Saturday afternoons at Wimbledon,
however, was at length at hand.</p>

<p>“We might go and have some sort of a rag on the
Common to-morrow for Lydia’s last day. Sunday
doesn’t count,” said Beatrice, on Friday evening after
supper.</p>

<p>“Quite a good egg,” agreed Olive. “Bob, are you
game?”</p>

<p>Bob assented without enthusiasm. He was stretched
at full length on the sofa, with his arms crossed underneath
his head.</p>

<p>Uncle Robert was behind his newspaper as usual,
and Aunt Evelyn was earnestly perusing a ladies’ paper,
from which she occasionally imparted to Lydia—the
only person who made any pretence at listening to her—certain
small items of information regarding personalities
equally unknown to both of them.</p>

<p>This was Mrs. Senthoven’s one relaxation, and afforded
her an evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Fancy! It says here that, ‘It is rumoured that a
certain demoiselle of no inconsiderable charm, and well
known to Society, is shortly to exchange her rank as
peer’s daughter for one even more exalted.’ I wouldn’t
be surprised if that was Lady Rosalind Kelly that was
meant. I suppose she’s going to marry some duke.
They say she’s lovely, but I wouldn’t care to see a
son of <i>mine</i> marry her, after all the stories one’s heard.”</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn looked fondly at the recumbent Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“I say, we might get the Swaines to come with us
to-morrow,” said Olive, “then we could get up a rag
of some sort.”</p>

<p>“I say, old girl, chuck me my pipe. The mater won’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Get it yourself,” retorted Olive, utterly without
malice, but in the accepted Senthoven method of repudiating
a request for any small service.</p>

<p>“Here’s rather a good story about that fellow—you
remember, Lydia, we saw his picture in the Sunday
paper—Gerald Fitzgerald, who’s acting in some play
or other. Listen to this!”</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn read aloud a reputed <i>mot</i> of the famous
comedian that did not err upon the side of originality.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that’s true, now!”</p>

<p>“Bee, chuck me my pipe,” from Bob.</p>

<p>No Senthoven ever listened to any piece of information
not directly bearing upon their own immediate
personal interests.</p>

<p>“No fear! What a slacker you are, Bob! Why
don’t you get up off that sofa? Lydia’s shocked at
your ways.”</p>

<p>“She’s not!”</p>

<p>“She is!”</p>

<p>Lydia hoped that she showed her sense of superiority
by contributing nothing to the discussion, which continued
upon the simple lines of flat assertion and contradiction
until Bob flung a cushion at his sister’s
head.</p>

<p>Beatrice thereupon hurled herself on him with a
sort of howl.</p>

<p>“Don’t make so much noise; you’ll disturb father.
Bee, you really are too old to romp so—your hair is
nearly coming down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>It came quite down before Beatrice had finished
pommelling her brother, and Uncle Robert had waked,
and said that it was too bad that a man who’d been
working hard all the week couldn’t read the paper in
peace and quiet for five minutes in his own house without
being disturbed by all this horse-play.</p>

<p>Lydia watched her cousins, despised them very
thoroughly indeed, and was more gratified than humiliated
when Olive remarked:</p>

<p>“It’s easy to see you’ve never been one of a large
family, Lydia. You don’t seem to understand what
rotting means.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you haven’t got used to being chaffed at
your school. It must be a sloppy sort of place.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you’d think so,” said Lydia calmly. “But
then, you see, the girls there go in for work, not play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they go in for work, not play, do they?”
mimicked Olive, but without much spirit, and as though
conscious of her extreme poverty of repartee.</p>

<p>Lydia noticed, however, that both the Senthoven
girls asked her frequent questions about her school,
questions which she answered with all the assurance
that she could muster.</p>

<p>That was something else to be remembered: it was
better to assume that if your standards differ from
those of your surroundings, it is by reason of their
superiority.</p>

<p>Lydia lived up to her self-evolved philosophy gallantly,
but she was in a minority, against a large majority
that had, moreover, the advantage, incalculable
in the period of adolescence, of a year or two’s seniority.</p>

<p>She did not like the feeling of inferiority, painfully
new to her.</p>

<p>At Regency Terrace she was the subject of ill-concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
pride. Even Grandpapa, although he never
praised, found no fault with her manners and bearing,
and had lately admitted—no small compliment—that
“Lyddie could manage Shamrock.”</p>

<p>Uncle George discussed chemistry and botany with
her seriously, and even allowed her opinion to carry
weight in certain small questions of science, and Mr.
Monteagle Almond always treated her like a grown
person, and alluded respectfully to the rarity of finding
a mathematical mind in a woman.</p>

<p>As to Aunt Beryl, in spite of the way in which she
had lately usurped Lydia’s recent rôle of invalid and
acknowledged centre of general interest, Lydia knew
very well that her own achievements and capabilities
formed the chief theme of Aunt Beryl’s every discourse
with her friends. At school she was not only liked by
her companions, but looked upon as the intellectual
pride of the establishment.</p>

<p>No one at Miss Glover’s bothered much about games,
and, anyhow, Lydia’s play at tennis was accounted
amongst the best in the school.</p>

<p>It annoyed her to realize, as she most thoroughly did
realize, that judged by the Senthoven standards, that
best was very mediocre indeed.</p>

<p>She had never played golf, or hockey, or cricket, and
her swimming consisted of slow and laborious strokes
that grew very feeble, and came at very short intervals
if she attempted to exceed a length of fifty yards.</p>

<p>Lydia’s ambitions would never be athletic ones, and
although she wished to be seen to advantage, she was
far too shrewd to attempt any emulation of Beatrice
and Olive and their friends upon their own ground.
She only wished—and it seemed to her a highly reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
wish—to show them that, in other and greater
issues, she, too, could count her triumphs.</p>

<p>She waited her opportunity with concealed annoyance
at its tardiness in coming.</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon picnic, ostensibly arranged
in her honour, was such a form of entertainment as
was least calculated to make Lydia enjoy herself.</p>

<p>It began with a noisy <i>rendezvous</i> between the Senthoven
family and a tribe of male and female Swaines,
ranging from all ages between eight and eighteen years
old.</p>

<p>Most of the Swaines bestrode bicycles, upon which
they balanced themselves whilst almost stationary with
astonishing skill, and presently, amid many screams, a
female Swaine took Olive and a picnic basket on the
step of her machine, and departed with them in the direction
of the Common. Bob and three junior Swaine
brethren, also on bicycles, laid arms across one another’s
shoulders, and thus, taking up the whole width
of the road, boldly invaded the tram lines, and
Beatrice, with her contemporary Swaine and Lydia,
started out on foot at a swinging pace.</p>

<p>“Give me <i>ekker</i>,” said Beatrice contemptuously.
“There’s no ekker in biking that I can see.”</p>

<p>Exercise, Lydia grimly reflected, they were certainly
having in abundance. She and Beatrice held either
handle of the large picnic hamper containing the Senthovens’
contribution to the entertainment, and as it
swung and rattled between them, Lydia made increased
efforts to accommodate her steps to Beatrice’s unfaltering
stride.</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” presently remarked Beatrice, with that
aggressive accent that to a Senthoven merely represented
the absence of affectation, “you’ll be saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
presently that we’ve walked you off your legs. I never
knew such a kid! Here, slack off a bit, Dot—she can’t
keep up.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>She had no breath left with which to make a long
speech.</p>

<p>Both the elder girls burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Come on then.”</p>

<p>It was a scarlet-faced Lydia, with labouring chest,
that eventually dropped on to the selected spot of
Wimbledon Common, but she at least had the satisfaction
of hearing her own name given in reply to
Bob’s derisive inquiry as to which of them had set
the pace.</p>

<p>Yet another proof of the profound wisdom of
Grandpapa who had said, “There’s no such thing as
<i>can’t</i>.”</p>

<p>Grandpapa’s theory, however, was less well exemplified
in the impromptu cricket match that presently
sprang up, in the sort of inevitable way in which a
game that comprised the use of muscles and a ball
invariably did spring up whenever the Senthovens
were gathered together.</p>

<p>“I don’t play cricket,” Lydia haughtily observed to
the least muscular-looking of the Swaine girls.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said her contemporary, looking very
much astonished.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to put into words the
humiliating admission:</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to.”</p>

<p>“How funny! But we’ll soon teach you.”</p>

<p>Lydia resigned herself, and since she was no more
deficient in physical courage than is any other imaginative
egotist, who sets the importance of cutting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
figure far above any incidental bodily risk that may
be incurred in cutting in, she successfully avoided at
least the appearance of running away from the ball.</p>

<p>The game, of course, was what was known to the
Senthovens as “a rag” only, since with deficient numbers
and a lack of implements, nothing so serious as
a match could be contemplated. Consequently, Lydia
presently found herself with Bob’s cricket bat tightly
grasped in her unaccustomed hands.</p>

<p>She was not altogether displeased. It was only
Olive who was bowling, and hitting the ball did not
seem so very difficult. She might possibly distinguish
herself even amongst these Philistines.</p>

<p>Lydia, in fact, was not above coveting the admiration
of those whom she admittedly despised.</p>

<p>“Chuck you an easy one to start with,” shouted
Olive, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Lydia jerked up the bat, but heard no reassuring
contact with the slow moving ball.</p>

<p>“Don’t spoon it up like that! You’d have been
caught out for a dead cert if you had hit it!”</p>

<p>A second attempt was made.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a duffer! Show her how to hold the bat,
someone.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s third effort mysteriously succeeded in knocking
down the improvised stumps behind her, whilst the
ball, still unhit, was neatly caught by a nine-year-old
Swaine child.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, this is awfully slow!” remonstrated
Bob.</p>

<p>“She’s out now, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Give her another chance,” said Olive, “let her finish
the over, anyway. There’s no scoring, what’s it matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Two more balls, then.”</p>

<p>But there was only one more ball. Lydia, desperately
determined to succeed once at least, exerted her
whole strength miraculously, hit the ball fair and
square, and knew a momentary triumph as it flew off
the bat.</p>

<p>There was an ear-piercing shriek from Olive, and
Lydia, terrified, saw her fling up both hands to her
face and stagger round and round where she stood.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, are you hurt, ole gurl?” came in anxious,
if rather obvious, inquiry from the surrounding field.</p>

<p>“Got her bang on the jaw!”</p>

<p>“What awful rot, poor wretch.”</p>

<p>They crowded round Olive, who was choking and
gulping, her mouth streaming with blood, but undauntedly
gasping:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, don’t fuss, I tell you, Bee, it’s all
right. I’ll be all right in a sec. I never dreamt she
was going to hit out like that. I ought to have caught
it.”</p>

<p>“Comes of having a mouth like a pound of liver
splits,” said Bob, quite unconsciously making use of
the strain of facetious personal incivility always used
by him to any intimate, and all the while solicitously
patting his sister on the back.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>Olive</i>, I’m so sorry,” said Lydia, far more
acutely aware than anyone else was likely to be of the
inadequacy of the time-worn formula.</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass,” returned Olive crisply. “Lend
me a nose wipe if you want to do something useful.
Mine’s soaked.”</p>

<p>Such of the assembly as were possessed of pocket-handkerchiefs
willingly sacrificed them, although the
number contributed proved utterly inadequate to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
amount of blood lost by Olive, still determinedly making
light of her injuries.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look and see if your teeth are all out,
old gurl,” urged Beatrice.</p>

<p>“I lost two last summer,” the eldest Swaine remarked
casually, “and Dot had one knocked out at hockey.”</p>

<p>“The front one feels a bit loose,” said Olive thoughtfully,
and thrust a finger and thumb into a rapidly
swelling mouth.</p>

<p>“Better not push it about,” someone suggested; “why
not sit down and have tea now?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to go home, do you, Ol?” Lydia
heard Beatrice ask her sister aside.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, no. Don’t let’s have any <i>fuss</i>.”</p>

<p>Olive could certainly not be accused of making the
most of her distressing circumstances.</p>

<p>She gave Lydia a tremendous bang on the back, and
said:</p>

<p>“Cheer up, old stupid! You jolly well don’t pretend
you can’t hit out when you want to another time,
that’s all!”</p>

<p>After that she took her place amongst the others,
and contrived to eat a great deal of bread-and-butter
and several of the softer variety of cakes, in spite of
the evident possibilities of a swelled and discoloured
upper lip and badly bruised jaw.</p>

<p>“Old Olive has plenty of pluck—I will say that for
her,” Bob remarked to Lydia, who agreed with the
more fervour that she was conscious of a quite involuntary
sort of jealousy of Olive. It must be so
much pleasanter to be the injured than the injurer,
and to know that everyone was, at least inwardly,
approving one’s courage and powers of endurance.</p>

<p>When the picnic was over, Olive had quite a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
escort to accompany her home, all relating in loud and
cheerful voices the various disabilities and disfigurements
that had sooner or later overtaken them in the
pursuit of athletic enjoyment.</p>

<p>“It’s part of the fun,” declared Olive herself. “I
only hope the mater won’t turn green at the sight of
me. She’s a bit squeamish sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Hold your hand in front of your mouth.”</p>

<p>“Keep your back to the light all you can.”</p>

<p>But it became evident that none of these precautions
would avail when Mrs. Senthoven was seen leaning
over the gate, gazing down the road.</p>

<p>She waved a yellow envelope at them.</p>

<p>“Tellywag!” exclaimed Beatrice. “What on earth
can it be?”</p>

<p>Telegrams were so rare in the Wimbledon establishment
as to be looked upon with alarm.</p>

<p>She and Olive both began to run.</p>

<p>“It’s addressed to you, Lydia,” screamed Beatrice.
“Come and open it. Come on, you people.”</p>

<p>The last exhortation was in encouragement to the
members of the Swaine family, delicately hanging
back. At Beatrice’s semaphore-like gesticulations of
invitation, they all followed Lydia’s rush forward, and
as she opened her telegram she heard their loud babble
uprise.</p>

<p>“Not so bad as it looks, is it, Ol?”</p>

<p>“She got a swipe on the jaw, and took it like a
brick, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear girl!” from Aunt Evelyn. “Let me
look this minute——”</p>

<p>“Don’t fuss, mater. It’s all right, really.”</p>

<p>They were all pressing round the reluctant Olive.</p>

<p>Lydia looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“No bad news, I hope, dear,” said Aunt Evelyn, as
was her invariable custom whenever present at the opening
of a telegram.</p>

<p>“It’s from Aunt Beryl about my examination,” said
Lydia very clearly.</p>

<p>She was so much excited that her tense, distinct utterance
produced a sudden silence, and they all looked
at her.</p>

<p>“<i>Passed your examination first-class honours</i>,” read
Lydia out loud.</p>

<p>“I <i>say</i>!”</p>

<p>“And you’d been ill the whole time, hadn’t you?
My golly!”</p>

<p>“Why, we thought you hadn’t a chance!”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you the youngest one there, or some rot
of that kind?”</p>

<p>“First-class honours! That’s as high as you can go,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>They were all lavish of exclamations and hearty
slangy congratulations.</p>

<p>Olive herself, and everybody else, had forgotten all
about Olive’s injury, and Lydia was the centre of
attention.</p>

<p>“I say, let’s have a celebration!” shouted Bob.
“Come in after supper and have a cocoa-rag.”</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted with loud enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“You can have the dining-room, dears,” said Aunt
Evelyn, “only not too much noise, because of father.
I’ll explain it to him, and get him to sit in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Uncle Robert never took part in any festivity of
his family’s. It was supposed that he needed peace
and solitude after his day’s work, and in summer he
pottered about the little green-house, and at other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
times of the year dozed behind the newspaper, unmolested.
Nevertheless, Uncle Robert, to Lydia’s astonishment
and gratification, actually came out of his taciturnity
that evening at supper-time in order to pay
tribute to her achievement.</p>

<p>“Fancy the pater waking up like that!” ejaculated
Bob afterwards. “More than he’s ever done for any
of us.”</p>

<p>“A fat lot of exams. we’ve ever passed!” said Beatrice
scornfully.</p>

<p>It was true that no Senthoven had ever attained
to any such distinction, and Lydia realized with the
more surprise that for this very reason they regarded
her success as something nearly approaching to the
miraculous.</p>

<p>Almost against her own will, she was struck with
Olive’s unfeigned relief at having the general attention
distracted from herself and her accident, and
focussed instead upon her cousin’s triumph.</p>

<p>Lydia half admired and half despised Olive, and
most wholly and thoroughly enjoyed the novel sensation
of being for once of high account in the eyes of
the Wimbledon household.</p>

<p>Certainly towards the end of the exceedingly rowdy
“celebration,” the cause of it was rather lost sight of
in the fumes of unlimited cocoa, the shrieking giggles
of the younger Swaine children, and the uproarious
mirth of their seniors, the whole-hearted amusement,
that almost seemed as though it would never be stayed,
at so exquisitely humorous an accident as the collapse
of Bob’s chair beneath him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the celebration was all in Lydia’s
honour, and her health was drunk in very hot, very
thick cocoa, with a great deal of coarse brown sediment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
at the bottom of each cup, afterwards scraped
up into a spoon, and forcibly administered to the
youngest child present, who had rashly declared a liking
for “grounds.”</p>

<p>Lydia, highly excited, for once made as much noise
as anybody, and began to feel that she should be quite
sorry to say good-bye to them all on Monday.</p>

<p>But she was much too clear-sighted in the analysis
of her own situations to delude herself into supposing
that a prolongation of her stay at Wimbledon would
result in anything but failure.</p>

<p>One could not pass an examination with brilliancy
every day, and once the first sensation over—which it
speedily would be—the old routine of walks and
hockey and “ragging” would go on as before, and
Lydia could no longer hope for anything but, at best,
a negative obscurity. Far better to leave them before
any of their gratifying enthusiasm had had time to
die down.</p>

<p>She could tell, by the very nature of their farewells,
the immense difference that now obtained in
their estimation of her importance.</p>

<p>“You must go on as well as you’ve begun, Lydia.
It’s a great thing for a girl to be clever,” said Aunt
Evelyn rather wistfully. “I suppose you’ll want to
take up teaching, later on?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I’m not quite sure yet.”</p>

<p>Lydia had long ago given up talking about her
childish ambition to write books, although it was
stronger than ever within her.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s time to settle yet. You’re not sixteen,
and there’s no hurry. I’m sure Grandpapa and Aunt
Beryl would miss you dreadfully if you thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
going away anywhere. It would be best if you could
get something to do down there, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Evelyn,” said Lydia amiably. She always
listened to older people politely and agreed with
what they said, but their advice had no disturbing effect
upon her, because it never seriously occurred to her
that anyone could be a better judge of her own interests
than she was herself.</p>

<p>Even Uncle Robert, hastily saying good-bye before
starting for the office, found time to say to her:</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, child. Don’t overwork yourself
with all this examination stuff. You can come down
here if you want a change any time. Settle it with
your aunt.”</p>

<p>“Better come down for the Christmas hols. We
can show you some tobogganing then, most likely. I
got some whopping great bruises on my legs last year,”
was the inducement held out by Olive. “I must be
off to that beastly old holiday task now, I suppose. I
always put it off to the last minute. Wish I was a
stew-pot like you.”</p>

<p>Beatrice and Bob escorted Lydia to the station.</p>

<p>“Well, ta-ta, and be a good girl,” said Bob patronizingly,
tilting his hat rather far back on his head and
smoking a cigarette that aggressively protruded from
the extreme corner of his mouth, “when’s the old man
going to have the decency to remember my existence?
You’ve cut us all out with him with your blooming
book-work. He goes in for being a bit of a brainy old
bird himself, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>Inured though she might be to the Senthoven vocabulary,
Lydia nearly shuddered visibly at the thought
of Grandpapa, had he heard his descendant’s description
of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Shut up, you ass,” said Beatrice, in an automatic
sort of way. “Well, bye-bye, ole gurl. You’ve fixed
it up with the mater about popping down again some
time, I s’pose. Just come and take us as you find us,
as the saying goes. Here’s your train.”</p>

<p>Lydia, leaning from the window of the third-class
railway carriage, wondered whether to shake hands
with Beatrice or not. The law of “No nonsense about
<i>us</i>” would certainly preclude kissing, even had she felt
the slightest desire to embrace her rough-haired, freckle-faced
cousin, shifting from one leg to the other, her
red hands thrust into the pockets of her woollen coat,
and her tam o’ shanter pulled well down over one
eye.</p>

<p>Bob was already casting glances in the direction of
the refreshment room.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Lydia, definitely deciding against
putting out her hand. “And thanks so much.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Don’t start speechifying, whatever
you do,” cried the Senthovens in protesting horror,
both at the same moment, and as nearly as possible in
the same words.</p>

<p>So Lydia was obliged to have recourse to that most
uncomfortable form of ejaculatory conversation that
appears to be incumbent upon all those who are unfortunate
enough to be accompanied by their friends
to the railway station.</p>

<p>“Nearly off now, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there’s the whistle.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Aunt Beryl will expect us to send
our love, or some rot of that kind.”</p>

<p>“All right. I think we really <i>are</i> starting this
time.”</p>

<p>We were not, however, and Lydia looked dumbly at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
her waiting cousins and wondered why, since they had
nothing more to say, and were obviously quite as ill at
ease as she was herself, they did not go.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t wait. We shall be off in a
minute now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Beatrice shifted her weight on to the other leg, and
Bob pulled out a packet of Woodbine cigarettes and
lit one of them.</p>

<p>“I hope Grandpapa will be in good form,” said Bob
desperately.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him you asked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother.”</p>

<p>“He knows there isn’t any nonsense about <i>us</i>,” said
Beatrice.</p>

<p>To this last familiar refrain, the train actually began
to move out of the station at last. Lydia waved her
hand once or twice, received curt nods in reply, and
sank back with a feeling of relief on to her seat.</p>

<p>The end of the Senthovens.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling glad that her visit was
over.</p>

<p>The familiar quiet of Regency Terrace awaited her
now. Aunt Beryl, as her letters had assured Lydia,
once more returned to the unobtrusive rôle out of which
her illness had momentarily forced her into unsuitable
lime-light. Uncle George, certain to be full of quiet
pride in the result of the examination, even Mr. Monteagle
Almond, next Wednesday, probably framing
elaborate little congratulatory sentences.</p>

<p>Lydia looked forward intensely to it all.</p>

<p>She wondered how Grandpapa would receive her,
and mentally conned over the amusing descriptions
that she would give him in private of the Senthoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
<i>ménage</i>, treading upon his well-known prejudice
against that slang in the use of which it was so proficient.</p>

<p>She did not expect to be met at the station, but sent
her luggage by the omnibus, and herself walked to
Regency Terrace by the short cut, remembering as she
did so her arrival, more than three years ago, under
the care of both aunts, and full of uncertainty as to
her own eventual destination.</p>

<p>Security, reflected Lydia maturely, was the most
important thing of all. One was secure where one
was appreciated, and held to be of importance.</p>

<p>She remembered that it was upon her own representations
that Grandpapa had consented—going
against his own prejudice to do so—to her being sent
to school. It had been a great success, as even Grandpapa
must have long ago acknowledged to himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day he might even acknowledge it to
her.</p>

<p>Lydia smiled to herself over the improbability of the
suggestion.</p>

<p>Then she turned the corner into Regency Terrace
and saw the familiar house on the opposite side of the
road.</p>

<p>As she caught sight of it, the hall-door opened, and
Aunt Beryl, in her well-known blue foulard dress with
white spots, that she generally only wore on Sundays,
looked out. At the same instant Lydia saw Grandpapa
peering from the dining-room window, which was
already open, and raising his stick a few inches in the
air to shake it in welcome.</p>

<p>All in honour of the great examination victory!</p>

<p>Lydia waved her hand excitedly, and at the same
moment, with ear-piercing barks, Shamrock shot out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
from behind Aunt Beryl, trailing a significant length
of broken chain behind him, and raced madly down
the road towards her.</p>

<p>Lydia, breaking into quick, irrepressible laughter,
dashed across the road and up the steps, in sudden,
acute happiness at so vivid a realization of her dreams
of home-coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> slipped by with mysterious rapidity.</p>

<p>Lydia was in the sixth form—she was a prefect—she
was Head of the School.</p>

<p>At seventeen she discovered that she had ceased to
grow. She had attained to her full height, and after
all, it was not the outrageous stature that had been
prophesied for her. Only five feet eight inches, and her
slimness, and the smallness of her bones, made her
look less tall.</p>

<p>Her thick, brown hair was in one plait now,
doubled under and tied with a black ribbon, and her
skirts reached down to her slender ankles.</p>

<p>Lydia still had doubts as to her own claims to beauty,
and envied Nathalie Palmer her bright, Devonshire
complexion and blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Should you say I was <i>at all</i> pretty, Nathalie?”</p>

<p>“Your eyes are lovely.”</p>

<p>“That’s what people always say about plain girls,”
said Lydia disgustedly.</p>

<p>“You look sort of foreign, and interesting,” said
Nathalie thoughtfully. “The shape of your face is
quite different to anyone else’s.”</p>

<p>It did not sound reassuring, and Lydia touched with
the tips of her fingers the salient cheek bones that gave
an odd hint of Mongolianism to her small olive-hued
face.</p>

<p>“Your mouth is pretty, it’s so red,” said Nathalie.
“Though I should like it better if your teeth didn’t
slope inwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Nathalie adored Lydia, but she was incurably
honest.</p>

<p>She went home for good the year before Lydia was
to enter upon her last term at Miss Glover’s.</p>

<p>“You’ll come and stay with us next year, won’t
you?” entreated Nathalie. “There’s no one but father
and me at home, but quite a lot of nice people live
near.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll come. I’d love to come. I should
just have left here,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Nathalie realized that on
leaving school she would be seeking for employment.
Most of Miss Glover’s pupils had their homes in the
locality, and went as a matter of course “to help father
in the shop.” Several found situations as teachers,
one had gone to Bristol University to study for a medical
degree, and only a minority, like Nathalie herself,
looked forward to living at home.</p>

<p>Lydia knew that she meant to write, and she had long
ago told Nathalie the secret of her ambitions, but she
had said nothing about other work, and the two girls
parted without having broached the subject.</p>

<p>“It will be time enough to tell Nathalie when I
know what I’m going to do,” reflected Lydia, with
characteristic caution.</p>

<p>She was sure that Aunt Beryl expected her to teach.
Miss Glover herself had hinted that a post as Junior
Mistress might be available in a year’s time to one of
Lydia’s abilities. That would mean sleeping at home,
having long holidays in the summer, and lesser ones
at Christmas and Easter, and a salary as well as her
midday dinner at school.</p>

<p>It might also mean a Senior Mistress-ship after a
certain number of years, an increase of salary, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
far-away, ultimate possibility of partnership with the
Head. And it would also mean an endless succession
of pupils, almost all local, a life spent among femininity
until her interests would all centre round numbers
of her own sex, and a narrowing of vision such as
must be inevitable in a mind exclusively engaged in
intercourse with the half-developed faculties of youth.</p>

<p>Lydia wished to leave the little seaside town.</p>

<p>Regency Terrace should be her home; she wanted
to come back there for holidays, and to receive the
proud welcome that had awaited her after her visit
to Wimbledon, when she had passed her examination
with first-class honours.</p>

<p>But her secret determination was to find work in
London. Only in London, thought Lydia, would her
vaunted capabilities be put to the test. Only there
could she hope to come into contact with that strata of
life, somehow different to the one in which Aunt
Beryl, or the Jacksons, or the Senthovens moved, and
to which, she felt inwardly certain, she herself would
be acclaimed instantly as by right divine. Finally, only
in the immensities of London did Lydia think that
she would gain the experience necessary for the fulfilment
of her desire to write.</p>

<p>Hitherto her keen critical faculty had left her exceedingly
dissatisfied with her own literary attempts.</p>

<p>Once at sixteen years old, she had entered a competition
started by a girl’s paper for a short story
“dealing with animal life.” Lydia had first of all
written a long and exciting account of a runaway elephant
in the jungle in India, with a little English boy—chota-sahib—on
its back.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl’s praises, which had been enthusiastic,
had failed to satisfy her, owing, Lydia supposed, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
her own intimate conviction of Aunt Beryl’s lack of
discrimination.</p>

<p>But she had disconcertingly found that it would be
utterly impossible to submit the story to Grandpapa’s
discerning ear and incisive judgment.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Lydia, disregarding a certain violent inclination to
shelve the whole question, had ruthlessly analyzed her
feelings of discomfort at the very idea of hearing
Grandpapa’s comments upon her work. There was no
doubt of it—Grandpapa would say that Lydia knew
nothing about India, or runaway elephants, or chota-sahibs—she
had suddenly writhed, remembering the
very book of travels in which she first met with that
expression—that her story was all written at second or
third hand, and was therefore worthless. With a courage
that afterwards struck her as surprising, Lydia had
envisaged the horrid truth.</p>

<p>She had lacked the heart to destroy the runaway
elephant altogether, but had stuffed the manuscript out
of sight into the back of her writing-table drawer, and
resolutely sat down to consider whether she could not
lay claim to any first-hand impressions of animal life.</p>

<p>The result had been a short, humorously written
sketch of one of Shamrock’s innumerable escapades.</p>

<p>Lydia had not been awarded the first prize, as she inwardly
felt would have been in accordance with the dramatic
fitness of things, but she had thoroughly amused
Grandpapa by reading the sketch to him aloud, and she
had taught herself a valuable lesson.</p>

<p>Experience, she had decided sweepingly, was the
only royal road to literature. She would write no
more until experience was hers.</p>

<p>Experience, however, to Lydia’s way of thinking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
was not to be gained by remaining at Regency Terrace
for ever.</p>

<p>When the last of her school days was approaching
rapidly, she decided that the time had come to speak.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, I should like to ask your advice.”</p>

<p>“Light the gas, my dear. Your aunt is very late
out this afternoon,” was Grandpapa’s only reply.</p>

<p>When Grandpapa simulated deafness, it always
meant that he was displeased.</p>

<p>Lydia obediently struck a match, and the gas, through
its crinkly pink globe, threw a sudden spurt of light all
over the familiar dining-room.</p>

<p>Grandpapa leant stiffly back in his arm-chair, a tiny,
waxen-looking figure, with alert eyes that seemed
oddly youthful and mischievous, seen above his knotted
hands and shrunken limbs. He could see and hear
whatever he pleased, but it was becoming more and
more difficult for him to move, although he still
staunchly refused to be helped from his chair.</p>

<p>“Lyddie, where’s Shamrock?”</p>

<p>Useless to reply, as was in fact the case, “I don’t
know.” The futility of such a reply was bound to call
forth one of Grandpapa’s most disconcerting sarcasms.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>Luck favoured Lydia.</p>

<p>As a rule, one might as well attempt to follow the
course of a comet as that of Shamrock’s illicit excursions.
But on this occasion Lydia at once found him
in the hall, and was so much relieved at the prospect
of success with Shamrock’s owner, that she failed to
take notice of the stealthy manner of Shamrock’s approach,
denoting a distinct consciousness of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>“Good little dog!” said Grandpapa delightedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
“They talk a great deal of nonsense about his sneaking
off into the town and stealing from the shops—I don’t
believe a word of it! He’s always here when <i>I</i> want
him.”</p>

<p>At which Shamrock fawned enthusiastically upon
his master, and Lydia determined the hour to be a
propitious one, and began again:</p>

<p>“Will you give me your advice, Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“Lyddie, you said that a little while ago,” said
Grandpapa severely. “It’s a foolish feminine way of
speaking, and I thought you had more sense.”</p>

<p>Lydia looked at her disconcerting grandparent in
silence.</p>

<p>She knew herself far better able to steer clear of
his many and violent prejudices than was matter-of-fact
Uncle George, or unfortunate Aunt Beryl, who
often seemed to go out of her way in order to fall foul
of them. But this time she was conscious of perplexity.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Grandpapa. I really <i>do</i> want
your advice.”</p>

<p>“Advice is cheap,” said Grandpapa. “A great many
people say they want it, especially women. What they
really want, Lyddie, is an opportunity for telling someone
what they have already decided to do. Then they
can say afterwards ‘Oh, but so-and-so and I talked it <i>all</i>
over and he advised me to do such-and-such.’ You
mark my word, no one ever yet asked advice whose
mind wasn’t more or less made up already.”</p>

<p>To take the bull by the horns was always the best
way of dealing with Grandpapa.</p>

<p>Lydia said resolutely:</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t yet made up my mind, Grandpapa,
that’s why I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“So that I can advise you to do whatever you want
to do?” satirically demanded Grandpapa. “Well, my
dear, you know me well enough to know that I shan’t
do <i>that</i>. Talk away.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Lydia began.</p>

<p>“I am seventeen, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>She pretended not to hear Grandpapa’s cheerful
ejaculation, “Only seventeen, my dear? Quite a young
child, then.”</p>

<p>“I shall be eighteen by the time I leave school next
month, and there’ll be my future to think about. I
know Miss Glover means to give me a chance of a
Junior Mistress-ship, or I suppose I could get a post
as governess, as Aunt Beryl is always suggesting. It
would be a pity to waste all my education at dressmaking,
or anything like that, though I suppose I <i>could</i>
take up something of the sort. Only really I feel as
though I’d rather use my head than my hands. Of
course, I like anything to do with figures, and Mr.
Almond seemed to think that I shouldn’t have any
difficulty in getting into the Bank here.”</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Grandpapa, “you’ve told me all the
things you <i>don’t</i> mean to do. Now tell me what you’ve
really decided.”</p>

<p>Lydia, although rather angry, could not help laughing
outright, and immediately felt that her laughter
had done herself and her cause more good than any
amount of eloquence. Eloquence indeed was invariably
wasted upon Grandpapa, who preferred any good
speaking that might take place to be done by himself.</p>

<p>“Now, child, have done with this nonsense and speak
out. What is it you want?”</p>

<p>Lydia drew a long breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“To go and work in London.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then Grandpapa said
in rather a flat voice:</p>

<p>“So that’s it, is it? Well, well, well—who’d have
thought it?”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa! you didn’t think I should stay here
<i>always</i>?” protested Lydia. “How am I ever to get any
experience, in one place all the time, never seeing any
new people?”</p>

<p>“‘Never’ is a long day,” quoth Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“But I shall have to begin soon if I’m to work at
all. You and Aunt Beryl have always said that I must
do something when I leave school.”</p>

<p>“And supposing I said now that things have looked
up a little, and you could live at home and help your
aunt a bit, and take little Shamrock out of a morning.
Eh, Lyddie, what then?”</p>

<p>Lydia was silent, but she did not attempt to conceal
that her face fell at the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” said Grandpapa again, “so it’s to
be London!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll let me go,” Lydia exclaimed, trying to
keep the eagerness out of her voice.</p>

<p>Grandpapa uttered one of his most disagreeable,
croaking laughs.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like a little fool, my dear! You know
very well that if you want to go, you’ll go. How can
I prevent it? I am only an old man.”</p>

<p>Lydia was disconcerted. Grandpapa never spoke of
himself as old, and the hint of pathos in the admission,
unintentional though she supposed it to be, seemed
to her out of place in the present juncture.</p>

<p>She grew more annoyed as the evening wore on, for
Grandpapa was really very tiresome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“A useless old man, that’s what I am,” he soliloquized,
taking care, however, to make himself perfectly
audible.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Grandpapa?” said the much
surprised Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>Everyone knew how angry Grandpapa would have
been had he suspected anyone else of looking upon him
as a useless old man.</p>

<p>“Anno Domini,” sighed Grandpapa melodramatically,
“Anno Domini! No one left but little Shamrock
to keep the old man company.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa!” cried Aunt Beryl indignantly, “I’m
sure if you had to depend on the dog for company,
you <i>might</i> complain. But you know very well that isn’t
the case. Why, here’s George only too ready to have
a game of Halma, if you want to. Or Lydia could
read out to you for a bit.”</p>

<p>“Lyddie’s off to London, my dear,” sighed Grandpapa
in martyred accents, for all the world, thought
Lydia indignantly, as though she meant to start off by
the next train.</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>But Grandpapa, having dropped his bomb amongst
them, not unwisely elected to leave it there without
waiting to see its effect.</p>

<p>“I shall go up to bed now, my boy. Will you give
me an arm?”</p>

<p>“But it’s quite early. Don’t you feel well, Grandpapa?
And what’s all this about Lydia going away?”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl received no answer.</p>

<p>Lydia was too much vexed and too much embarrassed
to make any attempt at stating her case, and
Grandpapa had begun the tense process of hoisting
himself out of his arm-chair. When he was on his feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
at last, he allowed Uncle George to come and assist him
out of the room and up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Good night all,” said Grandpapa in a sorrowful,
impersonal sort of way, as he hobbled out of the room
on his son’s arm. “I am getting to be an old fellow
now—I can’t afford to keep late hours. Bed and gruel,
that’s all that’s left for the old man.”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl looked at Lydia with dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about? Grandpapa hasn’t been like
this since he was so vexed that time when Uncle George
took Shamrock out and lost him, and he was away
three days before a policeman brought him back. I
remember Grandpapa going on in just the same way
then, talking about being an old man and nobody caring
for him. Such nonsense!”</p>

<p>Lydia had seldom heard so much indignation expressed
by her quiet aunt, and for a moment she hoped
that attention might be diverted from her own share
in the disturbance of Grandpapa’s serenity.</p>

<p>But an early recollection of the unfortunate effects
upon Aunt Beryl of her withheld confidence, five years
previously, came to her mind. Lydia considered the
position quietly for a few moments, and then decided
upon her line of attack.</p>

<p>“I know you’ll understand much better than Grandpapa
did, and help me with him,” she began.</p>

<p>Not for nothing had the child Lydia learnt the
necessity for diplomacy in dealing with those arbitrary
controllers of Destiny called grown-up people.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl seemed a good deal startled, and perhaps
rather disappointed, which Lydia indulgently told
herself was natural enough, but the subtle appeal to
range herself with her niece against Grandpapa’s overdone
pretensions was not without its effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>And Lydia found an unexpected ally in Uncle
George, when her scheme had presently reached the
stage of family discussion.</p>

<p>“You ought to get a good post enough,” he said
judicially, “but you mustn’t expect to keep yourself all
at once unless you ‘live in’ somewhere!”</p>

<p>“If she goes to London at all,” Aunt Beryl said
firmly, “she must go to Maria Nettleship.”</p>

<p>Of course. Maria Nettleship, the <i>amie d’enfance</i> of
Aunt Beryl’s younger days, who still punctually exchanged
letters with her, and was successfully managing
a boarding-house in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>“I should be happier about her with Maria Nettleship
than if she was just ‘living in’ with goodness
knows whom to keep her company. And it’s <i>nicer</i>, too,
for a young girl like Lydia—you know what I mean,”
said Aunt Beryl mysteriously.</p>

<p>“But a boarding-house is expensive. I never thought
of anything like that, auntie. Why, I should cost you
more than I would if I lived at home, a great deal,”
said Lydia, aghast.</p>

<p>“Oh, I could easily make an arrangement with Maria
Nettleship. And you want the chance, Lydia, my dear.
I’m sure I don’t blame you. It’s not a good thing to
stay in one place all one’s life long, I suppose.” Aunt
Beryl gave a sigh. “It would be just an experiment for
a little while, and I’m sure the expense isn’t to be
thought of when we know you would be paying it all
back in a year or two.”</p>

<p>“If it’s simply a question of the ready,” said Uncle
George solemnly, “I can lay my hand on something at
the minute. A bachelor has few expenses, and except
for the little I make over to the house, I can put by a
tidy little bit every year. I should look upon it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
quite a profitable investment, Lydia, I assure you, to
provide the needful on this occasion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle George—thank you very much. But
haven’t I any money at all of my own without having
to take yours?” cried Lydia, distressed.</p>

<p>Uncle George shook his head.</p>

<p>“Your poor mother was very unwise in the management
of her affairs—very unwise indeed. There’s a
matter of twenty or twenty-five pounds coming to you
every year, Lydia, and that’s about all.”</p>

<p>“Did that pay for my being sent to school?”</p>

<p>“There was a little money of your father’s, that he
left to me,” said Aunt Beryl hastily. “I was always
his favourite sister, whatever Evelyn may say, and it
seemed only natural that his child should have the
benefit of it, I’m sure. Now leave that, my dear, and
tell me what sort of work you think of looking out for
in town.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Uncle George, “that must be all
cut and dried before you think of starting off.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt almost bewildered by the rapidity with
which things appeared to be settling themselves. A
boarding-house in London, independent work, and
leisure and opportunity for the writing that was to
bring her fame and money! She remembered once
more, and this time with triumph, Grandpapa’s old assertion:
“There’s no such thing as <i>can’t</i>.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s determination to succeed, product partly of
an ambitious and resolute character, and partly of sheer
ignorance as to the difficulties that might lie in wait for
her, was enhanced by an ardent desire to justify the
astonishingly practical belief in her that Aunt Beryl
and Uncle George were displaying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Uncle George, who was not at all in the habit of
paying compliments, even said to her:</p>

<p>“I must say, it isn’t every girl who would have the
courage to start life as you’re proposing to do, Lydia,
and you deserve every success, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>After this, it was a disagreeable shock to find that
another, and entirely opposite, point of view could be
taken of her venture.</p>

<p>One Wednesday evening, to Lydia’s infinite surprise,
silent, dried-up little Mr. Monteagle Almond suddenly
broached the subject. He chose his opportunity with
evident care. Grandpapa, who still elected to maintain
his pose of rapidly-approaching dissolution, had
waited until the first game of chess was in full swing,
and then demanded plaintively if his son was too busy
amusing himself to give the poor old man an arm
upstairs.</p>

<p>“Excuse me one moment, Monty.”</p>

<p>Uncle George had departed dutifully.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the maid Gertrude had
put her head round the door, the rest of her remaining
outside the room, after the fashion most deplored
by Miss Raymond, and given breathless utterance:</p>

<p>“Oh, miss! Could you come out a minute, please?
Shamrock’s got his head squeezed in between the railings
at the back, and I can’t get him out, and he’s
howling something awful!”</p>

<p>“That dog!”</p>

<p>Permitting herself only this forbearing exclamation,
Aunt Beryl also had hastened away.</p>

<p>Mr. Monteagle Almond remained seated before the
chess-table, sedulously tracing a little imaginary pattern
on the board with one long yellow forefinger.</p>

<p>Lydia was seated under the gas, which she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
turned up as high as it would go, absorbed in finishing
a Sunday blouse for herself.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear of your projected departure,
Miss Lydia,” suddenly said Mr. Monteagle Almond.
“Quite a break-up of the home circle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” protested Lydia, who would have been
more deeply concerned at this fashion of viewing her
going if she had not been accustomed to Mr. Almond’s
sententious phraseology on every occasion. “Besides,
I’m not going yet. It’s only a plan for next winter
perhaps. I shan’t leave school until the end of this
term.”</p>

<p>Mr. Almond shook his head.</p>

<p>“A great wrench for old Mr. Raymond no doubt,
and he seems to me to be breaking up. To-night, for
instance, he was quite tremulous. I was sorry to see
that.”</p>

<p>“So was I,” muttered Lydia rather viciously. It
was really too bad of Grandpapa to put on those airs
that would take in anyone who did not know all of
which he was capable.</p>

<p>“The old are perhaps less apt at concealing their
feelings than we younger folk,” pursued Mr. Almond.
“Now, I’m sure my good friends, your aunt and uncle,
have not allowed you to see how deeply your decision
will affect them.”</p>

<p>“They’ve been very kind,” said Lydia with emphasis.
She was anxious that no one should think her ungrateful.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it at all—none whatever. A
most kind-hearted fellow is George—most kind-hearted.
And as for Miss Raymond—well, I need not tell you
what she is. I am sure that you remember her devoted
nursing of you—for which she afterwards suffered so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
severely—on the occasion of some childish ailment of
yours a couple of years ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. Almond fixed an eye of melancholy severity
upon Lydia, looking as though he were much less sure
than he alleged himself to be of her remembering the
occasion in question, and was consequently determined
to recall it to her memory.</p>

<p>Lydia was speechless with indignation.</p>

<p>Pneumonia a childish ailment!</p>

<p>One of the chief crises of her youth to be recalled
merely as the setting for the jewel of Aunt Beryl’s self-devotion!</p>

<p>Mr. Almond was worse than Grandpapa even.</p>

<p>It was clear to her that here was a point of view
which required readjustment.</p>

<p>“I shall be very, very sorry to leave home,” she said
earnestly. “But indeed I do think it’s the best thing
I can do. If I get a good post in London, it will lead
to much more than my just going on at Miss Glover’s,
teaching, for ever. And it seems a shame not to make
the very most of the education I’ve had.”</p>

<p>“Very true. But I’m afraid you’ll be sadly missed.
One had hoped, if I may say so without offence, to see
you taking your aunt’s place in time. She has been
very much tied now for a number of years.”</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> hope to help Aunt Beryl. But it would be a
disappointment to her and to Uncle George if I didn’t
do something with the education they’ve given me. In
some ways,” said Lydia, “the thought of going to London
by myself frightens me—but honestly, Mr. Almond,
I believe if I once take the plunge, it’ll turn out
to be the best and most profitable for us all in the long
run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>She saw by his face, with decided relief, that the
little man was becoming mollified.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you look at it in that light. You’ll excuse
me speaking like this, I hope, but I’ll admit to
you, Miss Lydia, that at first I was inclined to think
you might be going into this without much thought for
anyone but yourself. What you’ve just said shows me
that I may have misjudged you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” Lydia said deferentially, “I know it’s only
from friendship that you’re saying it at all. But I
hope you’ll believe that I really am not ungrateful to
them all—and I do want to make them proud of me.
I hope I shall, too, if I have my chance.”</p>

<p>The middle-aged bank clerk looked at her with a
gaze that seemed half admiring and half envious.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said slowly, “they’re giving you your
chance all right, Miss Lydia. And I hope, if I may
say so, that you’ll make the most of it, both for your
own sake and for theirs.”</p>

<p>And Lydia, whilst agreeing with him in all sincerity,
felt with an odd sense of triumph that she had reinstated
herself in the good opinion of the loyal friend
of the family.</p>

<p>This opinion received a startling confirmation the
next time that she saw him.</p>

<p>“Have you decided upon the exact nature of your
employment in London?” he inquired of her, with an
air of caution.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I don’t very much care for the idea of
teaching, and I should have to learn shorthand and
typewriting before I could get secretarial work. What
I should really like would be something to do with
figures—accountancy perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought so. The mathematical mind! A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
very rare thing in your sex,” said Mr. Monteagle Almond,
as he had frequently said before. “But subject
to the approval of your good aunt, I have here something
that may interest you, I think.”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl and Lydia gazed eagerly at the paper he
held out to them, covered with telegraphic notes written
in Mr. Almond’s neat little clerkly hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“New venture. <i>Robes et Modes.</i> Started last year.
Establishment owned by Lady Proprietress, personally
known to informant. Prem. in West End already acquired
and cap. assured.”</p>

<p>“Opening for educ. young lady; a/cs and help in
sales-room when required.”</p>

<p>“Live out; midday meal in. Special feature made
of employees’ welfare.”</p>

<p>“Personal interview previous to engagt. Probably
Sept. Salary to begin—no premium.”</p>

<p>“<i>Only superior young ladies considered.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>“The last item,” said Mr. Almond solemnly, “was
much dwelt upon by my informant—Griswell, of the
N. S. Bank. He could give me very few details, but
seeing that I was interested, he immediately offered to
communicate with the lady concerned, a personal friend
of his. He merely mentioned her name to me by
chance, and was quite surprised at my taking him up,
like.”</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you to pass it on, I’m sure,”
said Aunt Beryl excitedly. “What do you say about
it, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“I should like, if Mr. Almond will be so very kind,
to hear all about it,” said Lydia, her eyes shining and
her heart full of excitement.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Lyddie, I hope you’ll find enjoyment in
trimming bonnets for fine ladies,” said Grandpapa
caustically.</p>

<p>“She’s to keep the accounts, Grandpapa,” Aunt
Beryl repeated in loud, displeased accents. “Nothing
to do with the millinery, naturally.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that—not so sure of that. What
did the old party say about helping in the shop?”</p>

<p>“Madame Ribeiro only asked if Lydia would be
willing to give a hand at sale-time, or anything like
that, and of course she agreed. It’s her book-keeping
they want.”</p>

<p>“And who is Madame Ribeiro?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpapa!” cried Lydia reproachfully, “you
know very well that Aunt Beryl and I went up to
town this morning on purpose to see her. She’s the
old lady who owns the shop, and wants to run it on new
lines. Why, she’s a sort of lady, isn’t she, Aunt
Beryl?”</p>

<p>“It’s a foreign name,” was the indirect, but distrustful,
reply of Aunt Beryl. “I didn’t like to ask her what
country she belonged to, quite. Is it a French name?”</p>

<p>“Portuguese,” said Grandpapa unexpectedly. “There
are Ribeiros all over the Dutch East Indies.”</p>

<p>“She seemed a nice person enough—older than I
expected, and dressed very quietly in black, like a
widow. She certainly had a moustache, but then some
of those very dark foreigners <i>are</i> like that, and I’m sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
it’s her misfortune, and not her fault, poor thing—like
her stoutness.”</p>

<p>“She talked very, very slowly, and with an accent,”
Lydia said. “She never smiled once, either—I never
saw such a solemn face, and enormous black eyes. But
I think I should like her.”</p>

<p>“But it’s she that’s got to like you,” Grandpapa
pointed out. “You’ve got to work at the bonnets under
her, haven’t you, Lyddie?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly under her. She doesn’t come to the
shop herself, much—someone she calls Madame Elena
is in charge there. Madame Ribeiro lives in her own
house, in St. John’s Wood. But the shop is hers, and
she engages all the helpers herself. She sees them all
personally.”</p>

<p>“And is this precious shop in St. John’s Wood,
too?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It’s in the West End,” said Aunt
Beryl with dignity.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose Lyddie would like a little house in
Park Lane, so as to be near it?” Grandpapa inquired
with an air of simplicity.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you that Lydia was going to Maria
Nettleship’s,” said Aunt Beryl stiffly.</p>

<p>“I wish we’d had time to go and see Miss Nettleship,”
cried Lydia, hastily turning the conversation.</p>

<p>She did not in the least mind Grandpapa’s sarcasms
herself—in fact, she was rather amused by them—but
they always greatly discomposed Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>But when a definite offer had been made by letter
and accepted, and it was decided that Lydia was to
go, much sooner than they had expected, to London,
and work at the accountancy in the shop that old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Madame Ribeiro called “Elena’s,” she determined to
have some sort of an explanation with Grandpapa.</p>

<p>It worried her very much to see that he regarded this
first step in her career as a mere wilful, childish freak,
and something of a personal injury to himself.</p>

<p>The spirit of Uncle George and Aunt Beryl was a
very different one. They praised her courage and determination
in starting out into the world by herself,
and were full of pride in the letters so willingly supplied
by Miss Glover and Dr. Young, and the clergyman
who had prepared Lydia for confirmation, all
setting forth her cleverness, and her steady ways and
the achievements that lay to her credit in scholarship.
They were proud of her for having obtained so quickly
a post at a salary of a pound a week to begin with, and
her midday dinner and tea five times a week—which
practically brought it up to twenty-five shillings a
week, Uncle George pointed out. They would only
allow her to pay half of the weekly salary to Miss
Nettleship. The rest—an additional ten shillings—Uncle
George insisted that he should remit to Lydia
by postal order every Friday.</p>

<p>“That will leave you something for ’bus fares, and
dress expenses,” he said. “And I shouldn’t like you to
touch your own income, child. Let that accumulate
for a rainy day.”</p>

<p>“You can’t hope to save much at first, you know,”
said Aunt Beryl. “But you’re well off for clothes,
and won’t want anything new except the black dress
they said you’d need, and I can make over the old <i>broche</i>
easily enough. It’s beautiful stuff—you’ll only have
to get the cambric for the neck and sleeves. It’s a great
help to a girl when she can do her own dressmaking.”</p>

<p>They could think of nothing but Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Mr. Monteagle Almond himself, who had procured
this fine chance for her, was hardly given any credit by
Lydia’s uncle and aunt. They ascribed it all to her own
merits.</p>

<p>Lydia quite longed to justify all this faith in her,
and to repay Uncle George and Aunt Beryl for their
sacrifice. But she did not really feel much doubt of
being able to do so eventually.</p>

<p>This made Grandpapa’s attitude the more vexatious.</p>

<p>“I shall be able to come home for Christmas, you
know, Grandpapa,” she said one day.</p>

<p>“Where are we now—August? And they want you
to begin at the end of this month?”</p>

<p>“That’s so that I shall get used to the work before
the rush begins. The end of August is the slackest
time in London,” Lydia explained, and the next minute
was vexed with herself, as Grandpapa remarked
meekly: “Is it indeed, now? Thank’ee, my dear, for
telling me that.”</p>

<p>“I hope I’m going to make a success of it, and make
you all proud of me,” said Lydia with determination.
“You know, Grandpapa, in the evenings I am going to
begin writing. Do you remember that when I was
quite a little girl I told you that I wanted to write
books?”</p>

<p>“I do. You were a nice little girl, Lyddie—a sensible,
well-behaved, little child. Not like those hoydens
of girls at Wimbledon. If you write anything worth
the postage, you may send it to me—though I’m sure
I don’t know who’ll read it to me.”</p>

<p>This was the nearest that Grandpapa could be induced
to go towards any <i>rapprochement</i> on the eve of
Lydia’s departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>She said good-bye to him as affectionately as she
dared, and he replied calmly:</p>

<p>“Good-bye to you, my dear. Your Aunt Beryl wants
me to give you a Bible or some parting advice, but I
shall do nothing of the sort. If you’re a good girl,
you’ll know how to look after yourself, and if you’re
a bad girl, then all the advice in the world won’t keep
you straight.”</p>

<p>Lydia could not help thinking rather resentfully that
Grandpapa’s tones sounded just as though either contingency
would leave him equally unmoved.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Grandpapa—good-bye, Uncle George—down,
Shamrock—good little dog!”</p>

<p>But Shamrock pursued Lydia and Aunt Beryl all
the way to the station, and Lydia’s last sight of them
showed her Aunt Beryl and the station-master uniting
their efforts to prevent Shamrock from taking a flying
leap on to the rails.</p>

<p>She felt a little lonely, a very little bit frightened,
as the train rushed away with her towards London.</p>

<p>Eighteen, which had been a really mature age while
one was still at Miss Glover’s, no longer seemed quite
so grown up. The other people in the railway carriage
all looked much older than that.</p>

<p>Lydia’s habitual self-confidence began slightly to fail
her.</p>

<p>What if she proved not clever enough for the work
at “Elena’s,” and they sent her home again? Never!
She would take up teaching or dressmaking in London,
sooner than admit defeat. Besides, there was her writing.
She thought of various fragments that she had
already put on to paper, and which honestly seemed to
her to be good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>The day would come, Lydia was inwardly convinced,
when these would work into some not unworthy whole.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, she reminded herself, in an endeavour
to regain her poise of mind, that Uncle George,
Aunt Beryl, Mr. Almond, the Jacksons, Miss Glover
herself, had all thought her very brave and high-spirited
to go away to London by herself, and had made no
doubt that her courage and capabilities alike would
carry her on to triumph.</p>

<p>She remembered also that Nathalie Palmer had written
to her, in reply to her own long letter announcing
her plan. She drew the envelope from her pocket, and
read Nathalie’s warm-hearted inquiries once more, feeling
all the comfort of being so regarded by her friend.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lydia, I do think you’re splendid,” wrote Nathalie
from Devonshire. “It sounds frightfully brave to be
going off to live in London by yourself, and work at
the accounts in a big new place like your Madame
Elena’s. I hope you won’t be very lonely, but, of course
you’re sure to make friends. I do quite agree with you
that it will be a tremendous <i>experience</i>, and, of course,
I know experience is what you’ve always wanted. I
wonder how soon you’ll write a book. How proud I
shall be when you’re a famous authoress, and all your
books are in rows in my bookshelf.</p>

<p>“Father is very interested about you. He asked
what sort of boarding-house you were going to, and I
said of course Miss Raymond was frightfully particular,
and it was a friend of her own. He said he was
glad to hear it, and from what he remembered, you
were too good-looking to be let stay just anywhere!
I suppose he meant <i>men</i>!</p>

<p>“Remember you promised faithfully to tell me if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
anyone fell in love with you. I’m sure they will! No
one has with me, but I hardly ever see anyone. This
is the way my days are spent, mostly——”</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of Nathalie’s letter was not so interesting,
and Lydia put it away without reading further.</p>

<p>Her mind dwelt upon the first part of the letter, and
she smiled to herself.</p>

<p>Even though Mr. Palmer had not seen her since she
was fifteen years old, it was pleasant to know that he
had thought her good-looking, and Lydia was almost
certain that her appearance had improved very much
since then, especially now that her dark hair was
knotted up at the back of her head, with a high, Spanish-looking
comb thrust into one side of the thick,
outstanding twist.</p>

<p>“<i>I suppose he meant men!</i>”</p>

<p>That phrase in Nathalie’s letter kept coming to her
mind, and she smiled to herself a little.</p>

<p>It was quite time, Lydia considered, that she should
learn something about men.</p>

<p>Grandpapa was old and didn’t count—apart from
the fact that, as Lydia shrewdly surmised, he was quite
unlike any other man, and could never be looked upon
as the representative of a type. Uncle George and
Uncle Robert didn’t count, either—uncles never did.
Bob Senthoven Lydia dismissed with a shrug. She had
not seen him since her visit to Wimbledon nearly three
years ago, when he had made no favourable impression
upon the young candidate for examination honours.</p>

<p>The only other male acquaintance to which Lydia
felt that she could fairly lay claim was Mr. Monteagle
Almond. She remembered her conversation with him
on the subject of her departure from Regency Terrace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and the ease with which she had contrived to shift his
point of view until it agreed with her own.</p>

<p>Judging by that solitary experience, men were not so
very difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Lydia boldly admitted to herself that she hoped there
would be men at Miss Nettleship’s boarding-house.</p>

<p>The hope was realized.</p>

<p>The Bloomsbury boarding-house was large and dark,
and Miss Nettleship could accommodate an almost incredible
number of boarders there.</p>

<p>She was a brown-eyed, plaintive-looking woman, inclined
to stoutness, and concealing, as Lydia afterwards
discovered, considerable efficiency under a permanently
distressed voice and manner.</p>

<p>“I hoped your auntie might have come with you,” she
greeted Lydia. “I could easily have put her up—we’re
not so very full just now, and there’s always a corner.
I’m so glad to see you, dear, for her sake, and I do hope
you’ll be happy. You must be sure and tell me if there’s
anything——”</p>

<p>The eye of the manageress was roving even as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, dear—but you know what it is—one
has to be on the look-out the whole time—that’s the
drawing-room bell, and no one answering it. I think
I’ll have to go myself. I know you quite understand
how it is——”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship hurried away, and Lydia looked
round her curiously.</p>

<p>She was in the manageress’ own office, a glass-enclosed
alcove halfway up the stairs, probably originally
designed for a flowery recess, in the palmy days of the
old house. It was now boarded in halfway up with
light-coloured grained deal, but a few sorry splinters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
coloured glass still hung from the ceiling, clinking forlornly,
in solitary token of the once frivolous purposes
of the little alcove.</p>

<p>When Miss Nettleship returned, tired and apologetic,
but more plaintive than ever, she showed Lydia the rest
of the house.</p>

<p>It was built with a total disregard for domestic convenience,
that Miss Nettleship assured Lydia was characteristic
of old-fashioned London houses, but which
she could not sufficiently deplore.</p>

<p>“So difficult ever to get a servant to come here, let
alone <i>stay</i> here,” said Miss Nettleship, sighing.</p>

<p>Lydia did not altogether wonder at it, when she saw
the basement, occupied by kitchen, pantry, and scullery,
a gas-jet permanently burning in the two latter divisions—and
the only outlook of the former, rising area
steps, iron railings with cracked paint, and the feet of
the passers-by on the pavement.</p>

<p>The kitchen stairs, which led to the narrow hall, were
stone, very steep, and perfectly dark.</p>

<p>“However they do, with the trays and all, is more
than I can guess. Not that I don’t carry them myself,
often enough—but my heart’s in my mouth the whole
time. And girls are so careless, too! We had one
broke her ankle, running down these stairs, not a year
ago. Luckily she wasn’t carrying anything but an
empty tray at the time, but you never heard such a
noise and a rattling in all your life! It’s wicked not
having the serving on the same floor as the dining-room,
is what I say.”</p>

<p>The dining-room was on the ground floor. It was a
large room, with a long table already laid for dinner,
running down the middle of it, and dusty aspidistras in
pots stood in the bay windows, looking out, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
yellowing Nottingham lace curtains, at the grimy
dignity of the London plane trees on the far side of the
Square railings.</p>

<p>Opposite the dining-room was a smoking-room, Miss
Nettleship told Lydia.</p>

<p>“Better not look in now, perhaps,” she said. “Some
of the gentlemen may be in there.”</p>

<p>“How many boarders are here now?”</p>

<p>“It’s always varying,” Miss Nettleship declared.
“But I make rather a specialty, in a way, of permanent
lets. There’s old Miss Lillicrap—she’s always here—and
Mrs. Clarence, a widow, and in rather poor health—awfully
badly off. And the Bulteels—husband and
wife—with a boy who goes to Gower Street University.
They’re always here, more or less. And there’s
a very nice maiden lady has been here six months now,
and she’s said nothing about giving up her room. Miss
Forster—I’m sure you’ll like her, dear. She’s a great
card-player, and goes out a good deal. Between ourselves,
she’s one of the best boarders I have—very
regular in settling up, and always likes the best of
everything, and doesn’t mind paying for it. She’s
always sending in fruit, and the like. It gives quite a
tone to the house to see the boy leaving those baskets
of fruit two or three times a week.”</p>

<p>“Are there any girls who are going to work every
day?” Lydia asked, half hoping that the reply would
be in the negative.</p>

<p>“Not girls, no. Generally it’s cheaper for girls at
work to go to a woman’s hostel or into rooms,” said
Miss Nettleship candidly. “Of course, there are one
or two gentlemen. Mr. Bulteel himself has retired
from business, I understand, but there’s his son, Mr.
Hector, that I was telling you about, and there’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Greek gentleman just now, who’s only been here a
week. He goes to the City every day. I’ll introduce
you to everyone at supper to-night, dear. It’ll be
strange for you at first.”</p>

<p>Lydia was more exhilarated than alarmed. She was
not shy, and it rather pleased her to think that she
would be unique in her position of worker, at least
amongst all the other women.</p>

<p>“You’d like to peep into the drawing-room,” suggested
Miss Nettleship, on the way up to Lydia’s bedroom,
and from the tone in which she spoke, Lydia
guessed that this was the room of which she was
proudest.</p>

<p>It was certainly very large and very lofty, with
double folding doors in the middle, a marble fireplace
at either end, and the dingy remains of much gilding
still evident in the decorations.</p>

<p>A solitary little figure sat listlessly at one end of the
room, turning over the leaves of a battered picture
paper.</p>

<p>“Oh, good evening, Mrs. Clarence,” said Miss Nettleship
apologetically. “You’ll excuse me disturbing
you, I know. I’m just showing this young lady round.
Miss Lydia Raymond—Mrs. Clarence.”</p>

<p>The little lady stood up in an uncertain sort of way,
and put out a very tiny hand to Lydia, saying nervously:</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss—er—er.... I hope you’re
quite well.”</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” said Lydia, as Aunt Beryl
had taught her to say.</p>

<p>She despised Mrs. Clarence at sight.</p>

<p>The widow was very small and slight, and might
have been any age between twenty-eight and thirty-nine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Her hair was of that damp, disastrous yellow, that
always looks as though it had been unsuccessfully dyed,
her tiny, sallow face was puckered into fretful lines,
and Lydia felt convinced that she always wore just
such an untidy black silk skirt, showing a sagging at
the back, where it failed to meet the dingy, net blouse.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in silence, and Miss Nettleship
said at last:</p>

<p>“It’s quite all right, Mrs. Clarence—I knew you’d
quite understand—you mustn’t let us disturb you——”</p>

<p>She covered Lydia’s retreat and her own with her
usual harassed, good-natured apologies.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bulteel, and Miss Forster and Mr. Hector are
much more lively people than poor Mrs. Clarence,”
she told Lydia in a consolatory tone, on the way
upstairs.</p>

<p>They did not pause until the top landing of all had
been reached.</p>

<p>“This is bedroom number seventeen,” optimistically
declared Miss Nettleship, throwing open a door painted
liver-colour, and bearing that number on it in black
figures.</p>

<p>It looked more like a cupboard than a bedroom to
Lydia, unaccustomed to London, although faint memories
of lodging-hunting in her mother’s days came
back to her as she gazed round.</p>

<p>There was a combined dressing-table and chest of
drawers in the room, an iron tripod for washing purposes,
with enamel basin and jug, a couple of cane-seated
chairs and a low iron bedstead. A print curtain,
concealing a row of attenuated iron hooks and wooden
pegs, hung against the wall. The only window was a
fair-sized skylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I’m going to send you up an easy-chair,” almost
whispered Miss Nettleship, looking guiltily round her,
as though afraid of being overheard. “There’s one in
Mr. Hector Bulteel’s room, and really he doesn’t want
it—a boy like him. There’s a rocker broken, so I can
get it away to have it mended, and then I’ll bring it up
here. This room doesn’t have a rocking-chair by
rights, but I know myself the comfort they are when
one’s been on one’s feet all day. I’m determined you
shall have it, and I only wish it could have been here
to-day, dear—but one has to be a bit careful, and Mrs.
Bulteel is so sharp, too. But it’ll be quite all right—and
I know you quite understand, dear.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship seemed to find comfort in this assurance,
which she repeated almost automatically every
few moments.</p>

<p>Presently she left Lydia to unpack, telling her that
the bell would ring for dinner at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>“I’ve put you next me at table, dear, for to-night,
but of course I can’t keep you there. I wish I could,
but I know you understand how it is—people are so
particular. So you’ll understand if you’re down at the
end for breakfast to-morrow, won’t you? Everyone
takes their seat according to the time they’ve been here—and
the latest comers down at the bottom, so you’ll
be next to the Greek gentleman. Shall you find your
way, dear? I’d come and fetch you, but I must overlook
the waitress a bit—you know how it is—one can’t
trust those girls a minute.”</p>

<p>“Shall I come straight to the dining-room?”</p>

<p>“They generally wait for the bell in the smoking-room,
but they’re very prompt in. And you’d better
be prompt, too, dear. That old Miss Lillicrap’s <i>awful</i>
for taking half of every vegetable dish that’s handed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
and I simply can’t let them have more than enough to
go once the way round.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship went away, sighing.</p>

<p>Lydia thought that she was very kind, but talked too
much.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Aunt Beryl had told Miss
Nettleship all about her school triumphs, and the post
that they had obtained for her. The thought of Aunt
Beryl almost made her jump. Regency Terrace seemed
such a very long way off already! She could hardly
believe that she had been with them all—Grandpapa
and Uncle George and Aunt Beryl, and Shamrock—at
breakfast-time that very morning.</p>

<p>After she had taken off her hat and scrutinized herself
carefully in the looking-glass, Lydia wrote to Aunt
Beryl a postcard, to tell her of her safe arrival and of
Miss Nettleship’s kindness.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs.</p>

<p>She could not make up her mind to open the door of
the smoking-room, from behind which came the sound
of feminine voices, but hung about in the narrow hall,
under pretext of seeking a box in which to deposit her
postcard.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of a deferential voice in her ear
made her turn round.</p>

<p>“Did you want to post a letter?”</p>

<p>Lydia faced a slim, dark man, with glistening, black
eyes and a clean-shaven, swarthy face. She guessed,
from some indefinable intonation that hardly amounted
to an accent, in his quiet, silky tones, that this was the
Greek gentleman alluded to by the manageress.</p>

<p>“Is there a letter-box?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I hardly advise you to make use of it, if your card
is urgent. I have seen it remain uncleared for days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
The servant is very careless. But there is a pillar box
just outside. Allow me!”</p>

<p>Lydia hesitated, but the Greek put out a slim finger
and thumb, and neatly twitched the card out of her
hand.</p>

<p>“A pleasure,” said he, opening the front door.</p>

<p>As he left it ajar behind him, Lydia supposed that he
had only a few steps to go, and remained in the hall.</p>

<p>In a moment he reappeared.</p>

<p>“That should be delivered by the first post to-morrow
morning, Miss Raymond.”</p>

<p>Lydia wondered how he knew her name, but the next
minute she received enlightenment.</p>

<p>“I do not know the East Coast personally, but your
home must be in a pleasant spot. The seaside is always
attractive,” conversationally observed the Greek gentleman,
apparently unaware of anything obnoxious in his
method of acquiring information as to his neighbour’s
concerns.</p>

<p>The reverberation of a gong saved Lydia from making
any reply, although the Greek’s manner was so
much that of ordinary social intercourse that she almost
found herself wondering whether her annoyance at his
indiscretion were justified or not.</p>

<p>Before the sound of the gong had died away the
smoking-room door was opened, and half a dozen
people had filed past Lydia into the dining-room, each
one of them giving her a curious glance, sometimes
accompanied by a slight bow, as they passed.</p>

<p>She went into the room last, and was relieved to see
Miss Nettleship’s broad figure and coils of untidy
brown hair surmounting her pleasant, anxious-looking
face, at the head of the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>When Lydia was beside her, Miss Nettleship said
aloud:</p>

<p>“I must introduce Miss Raymond to you. I hope
she’s going to be here some time. Miss Lydia Raymond,
I should say. Miss Lillicrap—Mrs. Bulteel—Mr.
Bulteel—Mr. Hector Bulteel—you’ve met Mrs.
Clarence already——”</p>

<p>Lydia exchanged bows rather nervously right and
left. Mr. Bulteel, who had a melancholy yellow face
with prominent eyes, and wore an alpaca coat, and
trousers that bagged at the knees, was the only person
to smile at her—a doubtful, sallow sort of smile.</p>

<p>Lydia noticed that the Greek, although he had not
been named by the manageress, also bowed, much more
elaborately than anybody else, and sought her eye with
a meaning look, as though some understanding already
existed between them.</p>

<p>The meal was a very silent one.</p>

<p>“We quite miss Miss Forster; she’s always so
bright,” Miss Nettleship remarked in a general sort of
way. “I expect she’s gone to those friends of hers
again, for Bridge.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship did not visibly partake of the entirety
of dinner. When the tepid soup had been handed
round by a particularly heavy-footed, loud-breathing
servant, who never seemed to have quite enough space
to move round the table without slightly lurching
against the back of each chair in turn, Miss Nettleship
rose and hurried away to the basement.</p>

<p>“I always do the carving downstairs,” she told Lydia
in a whisper. “Then there’s no question of favouring.”</p>

<p>Equally Miss Nettleship disappeared again after the
meat course, presumably to perform the same office by
the pudding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“I’m so sorry, dear—but you know what it is—one
can’t trust those girls to themselves for a moment.
Irene’s such a feather-head, and poor old Agnes——”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship squeezed past the chairs, and hurried
away without particularizing the deficiencies of poor
old Agnes. Nor did they require pointing out, Lydia
reflected drily, if Agnes was, as she supposed, the cook.</p>

<p>After Miss Nettleship had left the room, the conversation,
such as it was, mostly came from Mrs.
Clarence and Mrs. Bulteel, a pinched, anæmic-looking
little Cockney with frizzy, colourless hair.</p>

<p>Hector Bulteel, a yet more pallid edition of his
mother, with an upstanding crest of hair that made him
look like a cockatoo, said no word throughout the
meal, and the Greek gentleman was equally silent.</p>

<p>Old Miss Lillicrap, who had her place at the right
hand of the manageress, only spoke in a shrill, quavering
old voice, in order to abuse the quality of her food.</p>

<p>Lydia looked furtively round at them all, and felt
rather dismayed.</p>

<p>She wondered whether they would ever take on the
similitude of real people to her, or if they would continue
to appear as mere grotesque figures that could
bear no serious relation to her new life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day following Lydia’s arrival in London was a
Sunday and gave her further opportunity for studying
her fellow-inmates.</p>

<p>She remained in her own room, however, most of the
morning, until the maid Irene burst in upon her, a victim
to that peculiar breathlessness so frequently characteristic
of lodging- or boarding-house servants.</p>

<p>“There’s a young lady wants to see you in the drawing-room,”
she panted.</p>

<p>Lydia, much surprised, went downstairs.</p>

<p>A strong and greasy smell of roasting pervaded the
stairs, and the clatter of a Sunday dinner in preparation
could be faintly heard ascending from the basement.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room sat old Miss Lillicrap, in a
violet silk dress and a lace cap with ribbons, nodding
above a newspaper.</p>

<p>A large, white-haired, but somehow youthful-looking
female figure, unknown to Lydia, bent over the writing-table.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood Lydia’s visitor, a
small, plain girl, with a pale face and untidy fair hair,
who put out her hand in a business-like way.</p>

<p>“I’m from Elena’s,” she said abruptly. “My name
is Graham. Old Madam said I was to come and see
how you were getting on, and if you’ll be ready to
start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Lydia. “Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Miss Graham selected a chair in the middle of the
room, as far as possible removed from the other two
inmates.</p>

<p>Lydia recognized and approved the intention, but
was acutely conscious that the pen of the lady at the
writing-table had ceased its scratching, and that the
newspaper of Miss Lillicrap was no longer rustling.</p>

<p>In the motionless silence of the large room Miss
Graham gave Lydia information concerning the establishment
of Madame Elena.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen old Madam, I know. She always interviews
us girls herself before engaging us. That’s
one of the things that’s done quite different to other
places. But it’s your first experience, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve only just left school.”</p>

<p>If Lydia hoped to impress Miss Graham by the announcement,
she was destined to disappointment.</p>

<p>“You may thank your lucky stars,” said that young
lady impressively, “that old Madam took to you. Girls
have been tumbling over one another, by all accounts,
to get that job of yours.”</p>

<p>“Madame Ribeiro seemed very kind,” said Lydia
demurely.</p>

<p>“You won’t see anything of her in the shop.
Madame Elena runs that part of it altogether. She
bosses the staff, of course, and does all the buying, but
she’s no head for figures, and that’s why there’s to be
an accountant. You’ll be sort of different from the
other girls, in your position. Higher up, I mean.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt very pleased, but she only said:</p>

<p>“Are all the others saleswomen?”</p>

<p>“Elena mostly does that herself, but she lets the
senior girl, Miss Ryott, help. She and the other one,
Miss Saxon, are really models. I’m at the desk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Do you like it?”</p>

<p>Miss Graham shrugged her little thin shoulders.</p>

<p>“I see plenty of life,” she remarked. “You’ll be in
the show-room too. There’s a table behind a screen
for you, all ready. The bills will be brought to you as
soon as I’ve stamped them.”</p>

<p>“Shall I help in the selling?”</p>

<p>“You’re sure to be roped in at sale-time. That’s
only once a year, thank God, and that was over last
month. On the whole, we’ve got a very good berth
there; I fancy quite different to shop-girls, or anything
like that. You get a topping meal in the middle of the
day—they say old Madam is frightfully keen on the
girls being well-fed. It’s a fad of hers. There’s a
housekeeper in the basement, an old woman called Entwhistle,
and she looks after the meals. There’s a first
and second table for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Are there enough of you for that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. There are two young ladies in the millinery,
and a fitter besides. And surely to goodness,” said
Miss Graham, “you know enough to know that the
shop couldn’t be left to look after itself for an hour in
the middle of the day.”</p>

<p>Lydia was not pleased at the slighting tone employed
by her visitor, and replied briefly:</p>

<p>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p>Then her natural instinct to engage the liking, and,
if possible, the friendship of those with whom her lot
might be thrown, made her exclaim frankly:</p>

<p>“I shan’t know anything at first, I’m afraid. But
I hope you’ll help me a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Miss Graham matter-of-factly, “I shan’t
have anything much to do with you. Old Madam
only sent round to say I was to come and look you up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
because there was nobody else. Miss Ryott is on her
holiday, and won’t get back till to-morrow, and Miss
Saxon is a new-comer herself.”</p>

<p>She rose, apparently indifferent to the effect of extreme
ungraciousness that her speech might well have
produced.</p>

<p>“I’d better call for you to-morrow morning. It’s out
of my way, but then Elena said you didn’t know London,
and would probably get lost. Will you be ready
by half-past eight?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lydia. “I’m sorry it’s out of your
way.”</p>

<p>“So am I, but it can’t be helped. Whatever made
you come to a place like this?” inquired Miss Graham,
throwing round her a glance expressive of anything but
admiration.</p>

<p>“The manageress is a friend of ours,” Lydia said
stiffly. “Do you live at home, then?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no. I share diggings with another girl.
Well, so long then. Half-past eight to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall be waiting in the hall,” said Lydia. “Good-bye,
and thank you for coming.”</p>

<p>She politely escorted Miss Graham to the front door,
where the smell of cooking was stronger than ever.</p>

<p>As she went upstairs again, the lady of the writing-table
came out of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said she brightly. “We must introduce
ourselves. I’m Miss Forster.”</p>

<p>She laughed heartily as she spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s nearly luncheon-time. Won’t you come back
into the drawing-room?”</p>

<p>Lydia inwardly wondered slightly why Miss Forster,
who had, according to the manageress, only been in
the house a few weeks, should adopt so proprietary a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
tone and manner, but she followed her into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Miss Lillicrap had gone away, and the room was
empty, as they took possession of two arm-chairs.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the place to ourselves!” proclaimed Miss
Forster with some obviousness. “Most people have
gone to church, but I’m a terrible pagan, I’m afraid.
Now, I wonder if I’m right, Miss Raymond—but I’ve
an idea that you’re a bit of a pagan, too?”</p>

<p>Lydia made a civil, but meaningless, sound in reply.
She had every intention of going to church in the
evening with Miss Nettleship, but considered that it
would appear offensive to proclaim her Christianity
bluntly aloud in the face of what Miss Forster so evidently
looked upon as a compliment.</p>

<p>She gazed at the lady, who continued to talk gaily,
and instinctively drew certain conclusions from the
scrutiny.</p>

<p>Miss Forster was a handsome, hard-faced woman,
presenting a great effect of careful smartness, between
forty and fifty years of age. She had obviously devoted
much whalebone and a certain amount of physical
force to the rigid corsetting of an over-ample figure.
Her extremely white hair showed the deep, regular
indentations of artificial waving, and was elaborately
dressed with a good many sparkling prongs and high
combs, visible even beneath the large be-feathered black
hat, pinned very much on to one side of her head. Her
shoes were small, with Louis XV heels, and looked
overtight for her short, plump feet, and her hands were
carefully manicured.</p>

<p>Lydia uncharitably surmised that one of the effects
at which she aimed was that of a woman who could
have married well had she chosen to do so, and that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
was to this end that she wore a sapphire and diamond
ring on the third finger of her left hand, and another
one with a large blue scarab on the forefinger of her
right.</p>

<p>Her voice was high-pitched and emphatic.</p>

<p>“Is this your first glimpse of the world?” she demanded
playfully.</p>

<p>Lydia felt rather at a loss for a reply.</p>

<p>“I’ve come up to work,” she said at last. “But I
hope I shall see something of the world while I’m
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect so. Of course, this is a quiet part of
town—not like Kensington or the West End, by any
means—in fact, I’ve never lived so far out before. My
friends are always trying to get me to move into a little
West End flat somewhere, but I say, ‘No; I don’t care
for the bother of housekeeping.’ And really we’re
quite well done here, you know, and of course I don’t
hesitate to order in any little extra thing. I’m afraid
I like my comforts, Miss Raymond. It’s what I’ve
been accustomed to all my life.”</p>

<p>“Have you always lived in London?” Lydia politely
inquired.</p>

<p>She was remembering Grandpapa’s axiom: <i>Always
let the other people talk about themselves.</i></p>

<p>It appeared that Miss Forster did not require much
encouragement to do so with great animation, and a
number of rather superfluous gesticulations, illustrative
of her words.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Miss Raymond! I always say I’m a
rolling stone!”</p>

<p>Miss Forster’s hands described rapid revolutions one
over the other in the air.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in all sorts of places, but I’ve come to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
conclusion that London is the place to live in. There’s
always something to <i>do</i> there. If it’s bad weather,
there are concerts or theatres always going on—and
one can always pop round to one’s club and get a game
of Bridge.”</p>

<p>As Miss Forster enumerated these resources of urban
life, she successively agitated her fingers up and down
an imaginary key-board, gazed eagerly through imaginary
opera-glasses held up to her eyes, and rapidly
dealt out a few imaginary cards.</p>

<p>“I’m a tremendous gambler, I’m afraid. I love my
game of Bridge. There are some dear friends of mine
living in Lexham Gardens, who frequently give Bridge
parties. I daresay you’ve heard of them—Sir Rupert
and Lady Honoret?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have.”</p>

<p>“No?” said Miss Forster, looking rather disappointed.
“She’s so very well known in Society that
I thought you might have. I must introduce you some
day. Such a clever woman!”</p>

<p>Suddenly an echo came back to Lydia’s well-trained
memory. She was in the drawing-room of the Wimbledon
house again, listening to Aunt Evelyn’s droning
voice reading from her illustrated paper:</p>

<p>“Fancy! it says here that ‘the wife of this city magnate
is no mean critic of <i>l’école moderne</i>, having herself
contributed on several occasions to the sum of
New Thought literature, in the shape of several
charmingly written sketches <i>pour nos autres</i>.’ That
would be this Sir Rupert Honoret’s wife, I suppose.
They say she’s a Jewess.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Lady Honoret write?” said Lydia.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Miss Forster delightedly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
thought you must have heard of her; she’s <i>so</i> well
known.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of her. I remember now,” said
Lydia, inwardly congratulating herself on the excellence
of her memory.</p>

<p>“I feel certain that you and I are going to be
pals,” Miss Forster exclaimed breezily. “Between
ourselves, there’s nobody I’ve taken to very violently
here. I really thought it was more of a residential
hotel than a boarding-house, or I shouldn’t have come.
One really can’t entertain one’s friends here, with such
awful servants, and that terrible old Miss Lillicrap
always about the place. She has a heart, you know,
so one can’t say much.”</p>

<p>Both Miss Forster’s hands flew to her ample bust,
in indication of the nature of Miss Lillicrap’s complaint.</p>

<p>“However, I belong to a <i>very</i> smart West End
Ladies’ Club, so I can always give my little card
parties there. You must come and have tea there some
day,” said Miss Forster airily.</p>

<p>“I should like to,” replied Lydia truthfully. She
was not attracted by Miss Forster, but people with
literary ladyships for their friends might be very useful,
and Lydia quite complacently told herself that the
accident of her having listened to, and remembered,
Aunt Evelyn’s item of information, had done her good
service with this woman, who might easily bring
her into that world where she most wished to find
herself.</p>

<p>She began to think that, perhaps, after all, the boarding-house
might count for even more than Madame
Elena’s.</p>

<p>At dinner, which on Sundays was in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the day, the Greek, who was her neighbour, talked to
her and asked if she were going out in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I have to unpack,” said Lydia demurely.</p>

<p>She had unpacked almost everything in the course of
the morning, but she thought that the Greek meant to
ask if she would go out with him, and instinct told her
that his evident admiration would only be increased by
a pretence at coyness.</p>

<p>“Do you care for the theatre?” he inquired next.</p>

<p>“Oh, I love it,” said Lydia frankly.</p>

<p>“We must make up a party one evening. Mrs. Bulteel
is very fond of a good show, I know,” said the Greek.</p>

<p>Lydia felt excited.</p>

<p>Evidently her life was not to be all hard work.</p>

<p>She ventured into the drawing-room after the hot
and heavy meal, but found that Sunday afternoon was
by common consent given up to repose.</p>

<p>Miss Lillicrap and Miss Forster both went to their
rooms, little Mrs. Clarence, sunk into an arm-chair
with a library novel, fell asleep at once, and snored
faintly from time to time; Mrs. Bulteel disposed herself
elegantly upon the drawing-room sofa, and said to
Lydia:</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind me having my toes up like
this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very strong. My husband and my son go
for a walk on Sunday afternoons, but I’m not very
strong.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bulteel closed her eyes complacently, and also
went to sleep.</p>

<p>Lydia took her fountain-pen from her pocket, having
first sampled the pens on the writing-table, and found
them all very old, rather rusty, and either broken or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
cross-nibbed, and wrote a letter to Aunt Beryl. She
gave full details of Miss Nettleship’s good-nature, and
of her visit from Miss Graham, and even reported a
little of her conversation with Miss Forster, the friend
of Sir Rupert and Lady Honoret. She said nothing
at all about the Greek gentleman.</p>

<p>The evening meal, at seven o’clock on week-days,
was not until half-past eight on Sundays, and Miss
Nettleship, after entertaining Lydia to tea in her own
room, took her to church at six o’clock, talking all the
way.</p>

<p>Lydia was bored, and in church began to feel rather
homesick and apprehensive of her first day’s work on
the morrow.</p>

<p>Supper proved to be a cheerless meal. There was no
soup, only portions of cold pressed beef and beetroot,
and a chilly helping of custard-pudding upon each plate.
The cheese was substantial enough, but the section of
the dish that held biscuits was empty by the time it
reached Lydia, and although she asked Irene for some
bread, Irene forgot to bring it.</p>

<p>She went to bed still feeling hungry.</p>

<p>Next morning she was introduced to the establishment
of Madame Elena.</p>

<p>“Us girls have to use the side door, of course,” Miss
Graham explained. But before they went inside she
showed Lydia the front entrance, with “Elena”
scrawled in gilt letters above the door, and a small,
diamond-paned window that displayed only a gilt chair,
over which was flung a brilliant scarlet and gold kimono,
and a little gilt stand, on which hung a necklace
of green jade, surmounted by a minute hat composed
entirely of fluted purple tulle, apparently held together
by a jewelled buckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Madame Elena dressed the window herself,” said
Miss Graham. “She goes in for colour contrasts.”</p>

<p>Her tone denoted no particular admiration, but
Lydia privately was a good deal impressed by the
window. Not with this wonderfully effective restraint
were the shop fronts decked into which she had hitherto
been accustomed to gaze.</p>

<p>She expected Madame Elena to be an æsthetic-looking
creature in an artistic smock, and was disappointed
at the sight of a very fat, good-natured-faced
woman, with an immense mop of auburn hair and a
heavily-powdered face. Instead of the art-smock, she
wore a tight black skirt, that seemed to emphasize the
disproportionate shortness of her legs, and a lace shirt
with an elaborate high collar and falling <i>jabot</i> of lace.</p>

<p>“Brought a black dress?” she inquired. “Rosie here
will show you where the girls’ dressing-room is, and
where you can leave your things. You change here, of
course. What about shoes and stockings?”</p>

<p>She shook her head at Lydia’s black Oxford shoes.</p>

<p>“Get a pair of court slippers at lunch-time. Rosie
will tell you where to go. Stockings don’t matter, as
you’ll be behind your desk all the time. You needn’t
worry about corsets, either, not being a model. Now
go and change, then you can come back to me here,
and we’ll go through the books together and give you
some idea of your job.”</p>

<p>“Are you nervous?” Rosie Graham asked Lydia
with a quick look, when they were in the basement
dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not really,” Lydia replied, with more spirit
than accuracy.</p>

<p>Miss Graham burst into an impish laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, you lovely little liar!” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Lydia was not sure whether to admit the truth of
the apostrophe or not.</p>

<p>She used all her intelligence during the next three
hours, but Madame Elena’s method of instruction was
slap-dash and sketchy, and Lydia learnt most during
the frequent intervals when her teacher was called
away, and she was left alone with the great ledgers and
invoice-books.</p>

<p>The technical terms, and the abbreviations especially,
puzzled her greatly, but much of the work reminded
her of the old problems at Miss Glover’s, when she had
been told to “show the working” on the black-board for
the benefit of the other girls.</p>

<p>The stock appeared to consist of evening gowns,
millinery and an occasional scarf or veil. Nothing was
made on the premises except hats, but Madame Elena
sometimes undertook commissions, for very favoured
customers, during her trips to Paris.</p>

<p>Some of the papers relating to wholesale purchases
were in French, and Lydia regretfully felt that her old
deficiency would find her out again.</p>

<p>In spite of the French, however, she thought that the
book-keeping would prove to be well within her capacity,
and felt cheered.</p>

<p>Madame Elena was very good-natured, not at all the
overbearing and dictatorial principal that Lydia had
half expected to find her. They worked together in
her room all the morning, Lydia uninterruptedly, and
Madame Elena in the midst of many respectful summonses
and urgent telephone calls.</p>

<p>Just before one o’clock, a tall girl with dark hair,
dressed in the saleswoman’s austerely smart black and
white, once more announced the arrival of an important
client.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Madame Elena darted through into the shop again,
and this time was away for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>Through the door of her tiny office, which she had
left ajar, Lydia could hear an occasional phrase:</p>

<p>“I really don’t think you’d ever regret it ... it’s so
<i>exactly</i> your style. I really shouldn’t urge it if I didn’t
think you’d be pleased with it.... Oh, <i>no</i>, Moddam—you
couldn’t call that <i>cerise</i> by any possibility. Old
rose it is—just your shade....”</p>

<p>Madame Elena came back at last, flinging herself
into the chair before the writing-table.</p>

<p>“Oof! I thought we should never get done. She
meant to take it, all the time, too. Now, Miss Raymond,
let’s see you enter that. Here’s the bill.”</p>

<p>“Motor-bonnet, at seventy-five and sixpence,” Lydia
read.</p>

<p>“You must describe it in your entry, so that we shall
recognize it,” Madame Elena declared. “Turn up the
invoice.”</p>

<p>When Lydia had found it she discovered with surprise
that the recent purchase figured as “Rose-red and
ash-grey motoring capote.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> sounds more like it!” said the principal, in
satisfied accents. “Now you’ll know how it should go
down on the account.”</p>

<p>She pulled out a gold watch from her tight waist-band.</p>

<p>“Poor child! the girls will have finished dinner. I
suppose they didn’t like to fetch you while you were in
here—and quite right too. You’d better come out and
get some lunch with me.”</p>

<p>They went out through the show-room, and Lydia
saw Rosie Graham sitting in the small, glass-panelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
box near the door, with neat piles of change on the
ledge in front of her.</p>

<p>As they went past, Lydia meekly walking behind
Madame Elena, Rosie made a derisive face at her, and
Lydia understood that it was an unusual honour to be
taken out to lunch by the principal.</p>

<p>They went to a small restaurant close by, and
Madame Elena made Lydia blush by remarking impressively
to the waitress who brought them the bill
of fare:</p>

<p>“Make out two separate bills for this, waitress.
Now, my dear, what are you going to have?”</p>

<p>Lydia had not expected to be Madame Elena’s guest
at the meal, but she considered the emphasis indelicate,
and wished that it had not been thought necessary.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, she liked Madame Elena,
who kept up an incessant stream of lively talk, and
gave her a quantity of information about the business,
the customers and the staff.</p>

<p>“That little Graham, now—she’s been with us ever
since we opened, and done her job first class. But
she’ll never do any better for herself than she’s doing
now. The reason why, because she’s got no tact. I’d
never trust her to show so much as a motor-veil to a
client—she’d tell her the colour was too young for her,
as soon as winking. Of course, my dear, I’m telling
you these things because you’re not quite in the same
position as the show-room girls. That’s an understood
thing, and has been from the first. More like my
understudy you’ll come to be in time, I hope. That is
if you and I understand one another, as I think we’re
going to.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt flattered.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my very best,” she said earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“I’m sure you will, and once you’ve mastered the
system you’ll be all right, and I’m sure I shall be thankful
to get the books off my mind. I’ve no head for
figures, and never had,” said Madame Elena, with
perfect complacency.</p>

<p>She dismissed Lydia at five o’clock, although the
working day was not over until six.</p>

<p>“But I know well enough what a first day’s work is,”
she remarked shrewdly. “You’ve a splitting head, and
don’t know a one from a two by this time. Trot along,
and if I were you, I’d walk home. The air will do you
good. You can start properly to-morrow. It’s a slack
time of year, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Lydia departed gratefully.</p>

<p>Business life was not going to be the inhuman affair
that books represented it to be, after all; Madame Elena
had been good-natured and patient, although Lydia
easily divined that she could be far otherwise on occasion,
and although she had had no opportunity for
intercourse with the other girls, they had looked at her
in a not unfriendly way.</p>

<p>She walked across the Park, gazing with interest at
the people she met, until she perceived that several of
the men that passed her were inclined to stare frankly
back at her, or to smile furtively.</p>

<p>Lydia remembered certain pieces of advice given
long ago by Aunt Beryl, and which had always been
disregarded, because they sounded so singularly superfluous
to the quiet neighbourhood of Regency Terrace.</p>

<p>She ceased to look about her, and walked more
quickly, conscious all the time of a certain exultation.</p>

<p>Surely men only stared like that at pretty girls or
attractive girls?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>She wished that she knew whether she were really
pretty or not.</p>

<p>In a very little while Lydia lost the sense of novelty,
and began to feel as though she had always been
independent.</p>

<p>She soon found that her life at Madame Elena’s and
her life at the boarding-house had both become quite
real to her, and very interesting. Each was absolutely
separate from the other, but both made up a sum of
experiences that absorbed and excited her.</p>

<p>People were extraordinarily interesting.</p>

<p>For all her capability and astonishing effect of maturity,
Lydia was not quite nineteen years old, and it
was only much later on that she realized how entirely
her interest in her fellow-creatures had confined itself
to the effect produced upon them by the personality of
Lydia Raymond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were wheels within wheels at Madame
Elena’s establishment. Romantic friendships for one
another amongst Madame Elena’s “young ladies,” sudden
desperate quarrels and equally desperate reconciliations,
all formed part of the fabric of everyday life,
and afforded discussion at the midday dinner in the
basement.</p>

<p>The girls, as Miss Graham had said, were all catered
for.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid to come again,” Mrs. Entwhistle,
the housekeeper, would exclaim jovially from the head
of the table, acting, it was understood, under direct
orders from Madame Ribeiro, whom the girls called
Old Madam.</p>

<p>It was well known that Old Madam would not have
anyone who might be working at Elena’s stinted of a
good meat meal in the middle of the day, which she
called “an economy in the end.” The number of helpings
was never restricted, and the meat was always
followed by a substantial pudding.</p>

<p>Lydia at first watched with amazement the two accomplished
young women from the millinery, both of
them pale London girls, send up their plates twice or
three times, in eager response to Mrs. Entwhistle’s
invitation.</p>

<p>Miss Graham, always at her desk, and the little
needlewoman who attended to alterations, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
only girls on the premises not selected, partly on account
of good looks.</p>

<p>“A pretty saleswoman sets off the goods,” was another
of Old Madam’s reported aphorisms. “Prettiness”
was the keynote of the establishment, and with
this end in view, Christian names were always used in
business hours.</p>

<p>Rosie Graham told Lydia that Miss Ryott’s name,
Georgina, not considered an ornamental one by
Madame Elena, had been abbreviated to Gina, as having
a pleasant <i>soupçon</i> of Italian romance. Gina, in
fact, rather looked the part. She was a tall girl, of a
full figure, with crape-black hair rolled back from a
round, cream-coloured face, dark-brown eyes and
beautiful teeth.</p>

<p>Gina only painted her lips a very little.</p>

<p>Miss Saxon, the other show-room “young lady” on
the other hand, who said that her name was Marguerite,
painted her face, as well as her lips, most artistically.
She was flaxen-haired and very slim, with babyish blue
eyes and a tiny mouth. She was always called for by
Madame Elena to show off any <i>toilette de jeune fille</i>.</p>

<p>Lydia found it easy to believe that the staff was made
up of young women taken from a class superior to that
of the ordinary London shop-girl. That was Old
Madam’s policy.</p>

<p>At intervals, Madame Ribeiro, always unannounced,
drove up to the shop entrance of “Elena’s,” in her little
old-fashioned, closed carriage, and walked slowly
through the show-room, up the shallow steps that led
to millinery, and into the small alcove, glass-panelled,
where sat Madame Elena, poring over large tomes, or
sometimes inditing scrawled communications on large,
mauve-coloured sheets of notepaper, with “Elena”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
carelessly running across the top corner of the page in
big purple lettering.</p>

<p>Old Madam never distinguished Lydia by any special
notice on these occasions. She generally remained
with Madame Elena for half an hour or so, and sometimes
the latter would strike her little bronze bell, and
ask, “Marguerite, <i>chérie</i>” or “Gina, my child” to bring
in afternoon tea for Madam.</p>

<p>“Anyone would think we were tea-shop girls,” said
Miss Ryott pettishly.</p>

<p>The order meant an excursion to the basement, where
Mrs. Entwhistle had to be found, the keys asked for,
and bread-and-butter cut very thin and arranged on a
china plate, and two or three sponge biscuits taken out
of a special tin, and the whole arranged on a small
green-and-white tea-service consecrated to Madame
Elena’s use. But then Madame Elena had her tea sent
up at a reasonable hour, when the girls had theirs, and
Mrs. Entwhistle prepared it, which she would never
do unaided at any hour earlier than four o’clock. If
Old Madam chose to have tea before half-past three
one of the girls must get it ready.</p>

<p>Gina, especially on a hot afternoon in the slack season,
very much preferred the shop.</p>

<p>“Shall I help you, dear?” affectionately inquired
Marguerite. “Lydia could give us a call if anyone
came in. Not that anyone will—they are all in Scotland
or at the sea somewhere—lucky things!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear—how sweet of you!”</p>

<p>They went away arm-in-arm, leaving Lydia drowsily
writing out “Marked down” tickets, copied from a list
of Madame Elena’s making.</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> friendship won’t last,” remarked Miss Graham
sapiently, from her desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>She was right, as usual.</p>

<p>Lydia had not been very long at Elena’s when the
Great Quarrel took place, and assumed an intensity
that could only have obtained during the month of
September.</p>

<p>It all reminded Lydia very much of the girls at
Miss Glover’s school.</p>

<p>Gina, it was evident enough, had hitherto dominated
the little group of girls, but her temporary infatuation
for the society of Miss Marguerite Saxon had rather
diminished her prestige, and Marguerite, moreover,
had made herself popular with the millinery young
ladies by talking agreeably to them at dinner-time,
when they sat together at the second table. Consequently
they championed her with vigour.</p>

<p>“It really is too bad, you know, dear. Marguerite
is awfully sensitive—those blondes so often are, much
more so than brunettes, I fancy—and of course she
feels it all the more because they used to be such
<i>friends</i>. That’s what hurts her so much.”</p>

<p>“Well, Gina is hurt about it, too—and has cause to
be, in my opinion,” inexorably said the girl who did
alterations.</p>

<p>The first and second tables were allowed to overlap
during the slack season very often.</p>

<p>“How did it begin?” Lydia asked.</p>

<p>But to this there was no satisfactory reply.</p>

<p>How did the slackening of those romantic bonds
first make itself felt?</p>

<p>“Marguerite couldn’t help noticing that Gina’s manner
had altered, of course,” said someone vaguely.</p>

<p>From this painful illumination it appeared as though
Miss Saxon and Miss Ryott had proceeded to revive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
their drooping interest in one another by a series of
mutual provocations.</p>

<p>“Gina is awfully proud. You couldn’t expect her to
take the first step. I mean, she’s so frightfully proud.”</p>

<p>“You know, I believe Madame Elena knows about
it,” said Rosie, giggling, precluded by Mrs. Entwhistle’s
presence from making use of the auburn-headed
principal’s usual <i>sobriquet</i> of “Old Peroxide.”</p>

<p>It was quite true that Madame Elena was inclined to
favour Gina. Lydia had noticed it with resentment.</p>

<p>When Rosie Graham’s shrewdness was justified, as
it almost invariably was, by the event, and Madame
Elena showed definite signs of partisanship in the
quarrel, Gina became established as the heroine of the
hour.</p>

<p>One afternoon, just before closing time, she suddenly
burst into tears after a prolonged search for a
mislaid pencil—that eternal preoccupation of the shop-girl’s
day.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” said Lydia very gently, and feeling very
impatient, since she disliked any display of emotion in
other people—unless it was directly concerned with
herself.</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you mine.”</p>

<p>Such a loan was unheard of, for the pencils, suspended
by a chain from each girl’s waist, were in constant
use, and the rule obliged each one to provide her
own.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care,” sobbed Gina, recklessly noisy.
“Thanks most awfully, dear. I know it’s sweet of
you—but I’m fed up with everything.”</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, still sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>“So are we all,” said Miss Saxon low and viciously,
looking up from the drawer before which she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
kneeling, carefully swathing some frail chiffon scarves
in tissue-paper. “So are we all, I should imagine, in
this heat and all, but we don’t make a song and dance
about it, I suppose. What <i>I</i> should call absolute carrying
on for notice.”</p>

<p>As though to verify the words, Madame Elena’s
glass door flew open.</p>

<p>“What’s all this noise?” she asked irately. “If you
girls think you’re here to make a row——”</p>

<p>Her eye fell on Gina, who had the wisdom to make a
visible effort to check her sobs and rise to her feet.
Lydia noted, with instinctive approval, that the face she
turned to her principal was paler than usual, with black
marks under either eye.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, I’m sure,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Gina was silent, gulping.</p>

<p>Madame Elena looked sharply round. Her eye fell
on Marguerite, still demurely smoothing out silver
paper.</p>

<p>Miss Saxon, less intelligent than Gina, and evidently
far less intuitive than the watching Lydia, made the
mistake of allowing a very small sneer to show itself
upon her little roseleaf face.</p>

<p>Lydia saw Madame Elena’s expression alter.</p>

<p>She laid an authoritative hand upon Gina’s shoulder,
and gave her a friendly push.</p>

<p>“Go in there,” she said. “I’m going to get to the
bottom of this.”</p>

<p>They vanished into the principal’s own sanctum,
Marguerite, apparently no expert in the interpretation
of signs, observing with satisfaction:</p>

<p>“I hope she’ll get properly skinned alive for making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
a row like that in business hours. Why, it’s downright
unladylike.”</p>

<p>Miss Graham, from her desk in the corner, gave
her little scoffing laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Marguerite. She was playing for
that, of course. She made that noise on purpose so as
Perox should hear her, and ask what was up. Old
Perox has been dying to hear what the row’s about between
you two for days, and now Gina can pitch her
own yarn. Just like Gina!”</p>

<p>Lydia was astounded, as she often was, at the little
Cockney’s penetration.</p>

<p>“Why are you staring, goggle-eyes?” said Miss Graham,
rudely but not unkindly. “Don’t you think it’s
true?”</p>

<p>With Marguerite Saxon’s small, squirrel face turned
to catch her answer, Lydia made a diplomatic evasion.</p>

<p>“Rather an unfair advantage to take, wasn’t it?”
she hazarded.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Gina you think so,” said Rosie, like a shot.</p>

<p>She burst out laughing at the dismay which Lydia,
involuntarily, and to her own vexation, felt that she
reflected upon her face.</p>

<p>“You don’t like that, do you?” remarked the terrible
Miss Graham. “You want to run with the hare and
hunt with the hounds—keep in with everyone all round,
and boss the lot of us. I know your sort. I daresay
you’ll bring it off, too, given you’re here long enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Lydia, instinctively
adopting the phraseology of her surroundings.</p>

<p>Rosie gave her little shrug.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, I’m only chaffing. <i>I</i> shan’t make
mischief. I like pulling your leg,” explained Miss
Graham kindly, “because it’s so dead easy, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Don’t mind her, dear,” said Marguerite. “That’s
her style, that is. It doesn’t mean anything. I say, do
<i>hark</i> at that girl in there!”</p>

<p>Faint sounds, as of an eloquent outpouring of words
mingled with an occasional sob, came from the partition
behind which Gina and the principal were secluded.</p>

<p>“She’s crying dreadfully,” said Lydia, with a dim
idea of diminishing, by her compassionate tone, the
effect of her previous comment upon Miss Ryott’s
methods.</p>

<p>A sardonic glance from Rosie Graham made her uneasily
aware that this manœuvre had been only too
transparent.</p>

<p>However, Rosie only remarked scornfully:</p>

<p>“Crying! That’s nothing at the end of a day’s
work. Anyone can cry in the evenings—in fact, it’s
easier than not. One’s tired, and it’s been beastly hot
all day, and it’s a relief to sit down and howl. Most
girls do it regularly if they aren’t going out anywhere,
and can risk having a red nose. Wait till you see a
girl crying at eight o’clock in the morning—then it’s
time enough to be sorry for her. If she cries then, it’s
because she can’t help it. If she cries at night she’s just
letting herself go.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> difficulty is that I never can cry, however much
I feel things,” said Miss Saxon, true to the feminine
instinct, so much condemned by Lydia’s grandfather,
of making instant personal application of a generality.</p>

<p>“I get awfully upset—quite foolishly so, mother
always says. ‘You’ll never go through life, dear,’ she
says, ‘if you take every little thing to heart so much.’
It’s awfully wearing, too—things kind of prey on me. I
just go on turning them over and over in my own mind,
you know. But as for crying—well, it’s just as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
I couldn’t. I’d give anything to, sometimes—you
know, I feel it would be such a relief, like—but I never
was one to cry, even as a child.”</p>

<p>Miss Saxon, much interested in her own monologue,
appeared as though she might go on for ever.</p>

<p>Rosie Graham made an expressive grimace at Lydia,
and formed with her lips:</p>

<p>“Good reason why!” at the same time pointing to her
own little sallow face, with a glance at Marguerite’s
carefully rose-tinted cheeks.</p>

<p>Lydia smiled discreetly, safely conscious that she had
her back turned to Miss Saxon.</p>

<p>The opportunity for which she had been looking
came that evening.</p>

<p>She waited for Gina.</p>

<p>The other girls went down to the dressing-room,
pinned on their straw and flower-wreathed hats, took
hasty glances into the tiny mirror propped up against
the window, and rubbed at their shining, heated faces
with leaves of <i>papier poudre</i>, torn from little pink or
blue books. Only Marguerite Saxon possessed a small
silver elegance, hanging from a long chain, containing
a little puff, with which she dabbed the tip of her nose
delicately.</p>

<p>“Good night, dear,” she said cordially to Lydia, who
responded as cordially, with her readiest smile. Already
she guessed that Miss Saxon was willing to make a bid
for her friendship, in the new-born apprehension that
the tide of partisanship was turning rapidly in Gina’s
favour.</p>

<p>With Gina, the advance was even easier. It was
long after closing hours when she finally emerged from
Madame Elena’s room, and then she was not alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Madame Elena, in the immense be-plumed hat and long
suède gloves that she always affected, preceded her.</p>

<p>“Lydia! What are you doing here?” she exclaimed
sharply.</p>

<p>“I’ve finished those Paris model tickets, Madame
Elena,” said Lydia meekly.</p>

<p>She had printed over two dozen cards whilst she
waited, it being one of the sign manuals of the establishment
to display all such tickets in elaborate fancy
letterings.</p>

<p>“You haven’t!”</p>

<p>Madame Elena made one of her rapid, swooping
movements, and snatched up a handful of the cards,
miraculously avoiding those on which the ink was still
wet.</p>

<p>“Now I call that charming,” said Madame Elena,
with genuine enthusiasm. “First class. How on earth
did you manage to get the letters all different and so
straight! But don’t stay overtime another evening like
that. You may find yourself locked in.”</p>

<p>She nodded and passed out of the side door, demonstratively
waiting for the two girls, in order to lock it
behind her.</p>

<p>“I get in here,” she said, pausing where a long row
of omnibuses was drawn up beside the kerb. “Good
night, girls.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Madame Elena,” they chorussed politely.</p>

<p>“Which is your way, dear?” inquired Gina, who
called everyone “dear” without discrimination.</p>

<p>“Right across the Park. I generally walk,” said
Lydia.</p>

<p>“Rotten to be so far off. <i>I</i> live miles out, too, right
the way to Mornington Crescent. I’ll walk with you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
if you like. The air’ll do my head good, and I may as
well get in at Oxford Circus as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Have you a headache?” said Lydia sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I should think I have! Why, I’ve been howling, on
and off, since five o’clock. I daresay you think I’m a
fool,” said Gina dolorously.</p>

<p>“No, of course I don’t. I’m so sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear. I don’t generally say much about
things when I feel them,” said Miss Ryott pensively,
“but I don’t mind talking to you, between ourselves,
like. Now, Rosie Graham—she’s the sarcastic sort—or
tries to be. I could never let myself go in front of
that girl——”</p>

<p>Gina paused, expressively enough, in lieu of seeking
in the barren fields of the shop-girl’s range of imagery.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” said Lydia. She had long
ago found out the incalculable value of this sympathetic,
and entirely non-committal, form of words.</p>

<p>“You may have noticed that I haven’t been exactly
what you might call a Sunny Jim lately,” said Miss
Ryott.</p>

<p>She looked sidelong at Lydia, who turned a deeply
interested gaze upon her, but said nothing at all. The
echo of Grandpapa’s wisdom came back to her, as it
so often did: “Always let the other people talk about
themselves.” And once more it was justified.</p>

<p>Whilst her companion talked, Lydia congratulated
herself upon the success of her manœuvre in waiting
for Gina, and at the same time impressing upon
Madame Elena, ever alert for signs of enthusiasm in
the staff, her eager devotion to her work. There was
not another employee in the shop who would voluntarily
have remained on after hours, apparently from
utter absorption in the task on hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Lydia marvelled, with perfectly genuine wonder,
that none of them should have the wit to see how enormously
worth while it was to sacrifice an hour or two
of leisure once in a way for the sake of the immense
effect that such a display produced upon the authorities.</p>

<p>She never made the mistake of attempting to deceive
herself as to her own motives, and was consequently
able to estimate to the full the results at which she had
consciously aimed.</p>

<p>“You’re a perfect dear to have listened to me,” said
Gina warmly when they parted. “I’m sure I’ve been
the most frightful bore, really.”</p>

<p>Lydia assured her that this had not been the case, and
was able to do so with the more earnestness that she
was inwardly full of exhilaration at the growing conviction
that her personality was once more giving her
prominence amongst her surroundings.</p>

<p>The next day Marguerite Saxon twice emphatically
called her “my dear”—a mark of potential friendship
as distinguished from the professional and abstracted
“dear,” that invariably punctuated the day’s intercourse.</p>

<p>She was also required to listen, during the tea-interval,
to Miss Saxon’s version of the recent disturbance.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that Lydia’s perfectly non-committal
sympathy was extended as freely to Marguerite
as it had been to Gina, with the result that each
declared a warm liking for her, and she speedily became
the central figure in their little world.</p>

<p>Madame Elena was not prone to personal enthusiasms,
and the signs that she gave of having distinguished
Lydia from among her compeers, were all but
imperceptible. Only Lydia’s ruthless clear-sightedness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
where her own interests were concerned enabled her to
discern them.</p>

<p>She soon found that the two young ladies in the
millinery were rather looked down upon by the show-room
young ladies, who had, indeed, little opportunity
for intercourse with them. Nevertheless, Lydia smiled
sedulously at them when she said, “Good morning,”
and never pretended deafness when one or the other of
them asked her to “pass along the bread, please,” at
dinner.</p>

<p>Consequently they were overheard to say to one another
that Miss Raymond was the only lady in the
place, so far as manners went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Entwhistle was somewhat of the same opinion,
since Lydia was the only girl who never grumbled at
helping her when Old Madam’s unexpected calls led
to a sudden demand for afternoon tea.</p>

<p>There remained Miss Rosie Graham.</p>

<p>Lydia was perhaps more nearly afraid of her than
she had ever been of any member of her own sex.</p>

<p>To a Cockney sharpness of tongue, Rosie added an
almost uncanny power of insight into the minds of her
neighbours, and it was commonly asserted amongst
the girls that she could “thought-read.”</p>

<p>The “thought-reading,” Lydia decided, was a trick,
based upon natural shrewdness and an almost infallible
instinct for the detection of small affectations and insincerities,
but it may reasonably be supposed that it
added no sense of security to the circles of which Miss
Graham was a member.</p>

<p>Lydia knew that Rosie was not, and never would be,
popular, but she uneasily surmised in her a strength of
character that might equal, if it did not surpass, her
own. And the idea was disturbing to Lydia’s conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of her own allotted rôle in life, well to the forefront
of the stage.</p>

<p>She was always charming to Miss Graham, in accordance
with her invariable rule, but after three
months at Madame Elena’s she was still vexedly aware
that the medium by which the charm could be made
efficacious had yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>It was obviously waste of time to say to Rosie, as
she might have said to Marguerite Saxon, for instance:</p>

<p>“You do look tired to-day. I’m sure you’re not a
bit strong.”</p>

<p>For, whereas Miss Saxon would have denied the
charge, simpering with gratification the while, and at
an early opportunity have returned the kindness by
some such compliment as, “What a sweet figure that
costume gives you, dear. I’m sure you wear lovely
corsets,” it might safely be assumed that Rosie would
shrug her shoulders, and retort matter-of-factly that
her pallor was due to indigestion. She frankly disliked
personalities, although she was willing enough to
give her opinion, uncivilly and often unkindly, although
never maliciously, in regard to other people.</p>

<p>Lydia sometimes thought that the only avenue of
approach lay in the sense of humour that they shared,
and which was deficient in the other members of the
small group. And it always gave her an odd sense of
reassurance when, in the course of the day, some trivial
incident, or chance word, would cause her eyes and
those of Rosie Graham to meet, involuntarily and quite
instinctively, in a silent laugh.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There’s</span> only one piece each,” said old Miss Lillicrap,
in the sharp, fierce squeak that the other boarders
always heard with dismayed resentment, rendered
powerless because of her extreme age, and the violet
tinge that shadowed her hard old lips.</p>

<p>Miss Lillicrap had been known to have a violent
and mysterious “attack” for a less reason than the
appropriation of a second piece of seed-cake at tea-time
on a Sunday afternoon by someone other than herself.</p>

<p>The boarders assembled in the drawing-room instantly
entered into the unanimous league of a silent
resolution to ignore Miss Lillicrap’s indelicate insistence
on the extremely limited quantity of cake supplied
by Miss Nettleship.</p>

<p>“Meal-time again!” sighed little Mrs. Clarence, at
the same time edging her chair forward, so as to sit
nearest to the small milk-jug and inadequately-filled
sugar-basin. “It always seems to be time to eat, somehow.”
Her pale, pink-rimmed blue eyes were anxiously
scanning the food on the table as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Only one piece each,” snapped Miss Lillicrap again,
more loudly than before.</p>

<p>Again they all ignored her.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to do ‘mother,’ and pour out?” asked
Mrs. Bulteel with a rather nervous laugh.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that as the principal married woman
in the room, she felt herself entitled to the office of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
dignity. Almost equally well, everyone knew that it
would be disputed.</p>

<p>“I thought Miss Forster did that,” said old Miss
Lillicrap.</p>

<p>Had Miss Forster been present she would certainly
have supported Mrs. Bulteel.</p>

<p>“Miss Forster is out, Miss Lillicrap,” retorted Mrs.
Bulteel, raising her already shrill voice, so as to impress
upon Miss Lillicrap that she was old, and must
therefore be very deaf as well.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right—all right. Yesterday I was awake
nearly all night, the tea was so strong.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the first cup,” shrilled Mrs. Bulteel,
provided with an excellent excuse for snatching the
tea-pot before Mrs. Clarence, who, as a widow, could
have no status at all, could put her little be-ringed,
claw-like fingers round the handle.</p>

<p>Lydia, who, for reasons connected with her own
undoubted popularity at the boarding-house, never took
part in the tea-time amenities of the boarders—of
which, indeed, she was only witness on occasional Saturday
and Sunday afternoons—looked sympathetically
at Mr. Bulteel, waiting nervously for the teacups which
he habitually handed politely round.</p>

<p>He evidently thought his wife very spirited and
clever when she used her shrewish Cockney tongue
against the other women.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” said he, taking round the cups of
strong, black brew. He threw a resentful glance, as he
did so, at the Greek gentleman, who never took his
share in dispensing these small courtesies. He only
stood, as he usually did, in front of the empty fireplace,
his hands in his pockets, and his dark eyes roaming
sardonically round the room. He was still spoken of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as “the Greek gentleman,” since no one had mastered
his name. Lydia had listened with interest to various
conversations about him, but had derived little information
from them. It might be entertaining, but it was
not particularly illuminating to hear Mrs. Bulteel say
to Mrs. Clarence, as Lydia had heard her say a little
while ago, in a very penetrating manner:</p>

<p>“That’s not a face I should <i>trust</i>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarence, who never ventured to differ from
anybody, and least of all from Mrs. Bulteel, who had a
live husband and son to testify to the fact that she had
justified her feminine existence, had only replied
doubtfully:</p>

<p>“No? Well, perhaps you’re right. What makes you
think...?”</p>

<p>“He looks as though he had foreign blood in him.”
Mrs. Bulteel adduced the damning grounds for her inference
with gloomy prescience, which she appeared to
think amply justified by the facts that the Greek spoke
English with a slight accent, and had a name
that even Miss Nettleship only rendered as Mr.
M ... m ... m.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards the unconquerable Mrs.
Bulteel had actually asked him outright, “And do tell
me, <i>how</i> is your name pronounced?” in a very intelligent
way, as though she knew of two or three excellent
alternatives.</p>

<p>To which the Greek gentleman had replied, with
slightly outspread, olive fingers:</p>

<p>“Just—exactly—as you please.”</p>

<p>“But how do <i>you</i> say it in your own country?”</p>

<p>“I am not in my own country.”</p>

<p>“I know that. You are a foreigner,” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Bulteel, much as she might have said, “You are a cannibal.”
“But if you <i>were</i> in your own country?”</p>

<p>Then had replied the Greek gentleman morosely:</p>

<p>“I should have no need to say it at all. It is too well
known.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Bulteel, seeing herself defeated, could
only cry out in a shaking voice the time-honoured indictment
of the English middle classes of whatever is
slightly less than blatantly obvious:</p>

<p>“Oh! How sarcastic!”</p>

<p>Nothing could be more evident than that the Greek
was indifferent to the charge, or, indeed, to any other
that might be proffered against him by his fellow-inmates.</p>

<p>That very Sunday morning had been spent by him
in reading a French novel in the drawing-room, whilst
almost all the other inmates had decorously attended
church.</p>

<p>“Will you keep some tea for Hector?” suggested
Mr. Bulteel, as his wife put down the tea-pot and uncrooked
her little finger.</p>

<p>“I have come to an arrangement with the manageress
about Hector’s tea,” retorted Mrs. Bulteel, with a magnificence
that seemed inadequate to the cup of strong
tea, and slices of bread-and-butter on a thick plate now
probably waiting on the kitchen range for Hector’s
return.</p>

<p>“The poor boy is never much later than half-past
five, after all, even on week-days.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarence and Miss Lillicrap exchanged a look.
Everyone knew that the main interest of the senior
members of the Bulteel <i>ménage</i> was to exercise a rigorous
censorship over every unaccounted-for moment of
their only son’s existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>It was as a matter of course that everyone present
heard the accustomed routine of question and answer
gone through by Hector and his parents on the youth’s
entrance into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Hector?” said Mrs. Bulteel mildly, as
soon as her son had slouched to a seat, and no further
doubt of his identity could possibly prevail.</p>

<p>“Have you asked for your tea?” Mr. Bulteel inquired.</p>

<p>“The girl opened the door to me.”</p>

<p>Few of the boarders possessed latch-keys, and Hector
was not one of these.</p>

<p>“That girl!” exclaimed his mother. “Better ring,
and I’ll tell her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarence looked rather awed. She would never
have dared to ring the drawing-room bell for the parlour-maid.</p>

<p>Lydia herself had come in late for tea, and although
Mr. Bulteel had handed her a cup, smiling rather apologetically,
there was very little left to eat.</p>

<p>“There’s no more cake—nothing left!” cried old
Miss Lillicrap with a sort of vicious triumph, as Lydia
gazed at the empty plates on the table.</p>

<p>Lydia shrugged her shoulders, and Mr. Bulteel said
nervously and kindly:</p>

<p>“They will bring you some more, no doubt.”</p>

<p>Everybody knew that any such concession to a late
arrival was most unlikely, and the effect produced was
proportionate when the Greek gentleman, on the arrival
of Hector Bulteel’s belated cup and saucer, turned
to the maid who had brought them in:</p>

<p>“This young lady will want some tea and bread-and-butter,
also.”</p>

<p>Irene looked astounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The Greek gentleman fixed upon her the steady,
sardonic gaze of his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“If you please,” he said, with the unctuous sibilance
that was the only accent marring the perfection of his
English speech.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what the manageress says,” gasped Irene,
and they heard her clattering down the stairs.</p>

<p>The boarders exchanged glances, of which Lydia was
perfectly aware, and which did not altogether displease
her. She knew that they were all waiting curiously to
see the outcome of Irene’s mission, and the Greek’s
reception of its almost certain failure. Miss Nettleship
had long ago explained to Lydia that she dared not
make any difference in her treatment of the boarders.</p>

<p>“You quite understand how it is, dear, I know. The
boarders know very well that your aunt is a friend of
mine, and so they’re sort of on the look-out for any
favouring. And it wouldn’t do at all, would it, to
have any talk made? It would only be disagreeable for
both of us—you know how it is, dear.”</p>

<p>Irene reappeared at the door, breathless.</p>

<p>“Miss Nettleship’s very sorry, there’s no more boiling
water,” she announced defiantly, and disappeared
before the Greek gentleman could do more than look at
her, which he did as disagreeably as was possible in the
time.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he remarked gravely to the object of
his benevolence.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” said Lydia, smiling.</p>

<p>“But it’s not right,” cried Mr. Bulteel, as though
sheer distress were compelling him to break into the
conversation contrary to his will, and certainly contrary
to his usual habit.</p>

<p>“It’s not <i>right</i>. One pays for tea, and one ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
have it. She never deducts a meal like tea from the
bill, even if one hasn’t had it.”</p>

<p>His wife tittered shrilly.</p>

<p>“I should think she didn’t! It’s disgraceful the way
that woman charges for the food. No one ever has a
second helping.”</p>

<p>The room became animated on the instant.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulteel had introduced one of those topics, that,
from sheer force of unending discussion in the past,
become eagerly acclaimed as suitable for unending discussion
in the present.</p>

<p>“I <i>ask</i> for a second helping,” said old Miss Lillicrap
triumphantly. “I <i>ask</i> for it. And I get it, too. I had
two helpings of the pudding yesterday, and I sent the
girl back for some custard. She brought it to me without
any custard the second time, but I sent her back for
it. It was the disobliging waitress, too, not Irene, and I
could see she didn’t like it. But she had to go back for
the custard, and Miss Nettleship gave it to her. She
knew it was for me, and she didn’t dare to refuse it.”</p>

<p>No one congratulated Miss Lillicrap on her achievement.
She was very unpopular, and it was evident that
to most of the boarders the recollection sprang to mind
vividly of the methods to which she had recourse for
the maintenance of her privileges. Indeed, Miss Nettleship
had herself told Lydia of her own defeat at the
aged but determined hands of Miss Lillicrap, who had
once had five cardiac attacks in succession sooner than
pay a disputed item on her weekly bill, emerging from
each one in order to say, “It’s extortionate, and you’ll
have to take it off. I shan’t pay.”</p>

<p>When she had said it five times, and showed an iron
intention of relapsing into a sixth catalepsy, as a preliminary
to saying it again, the manageress had cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
up her eyes to heaven, and exclaimed that the charge
should be remitted.</p>

<p>Thereafter Miss Lillicrap had the upper hand, and
knew it, and Miss Nettleship was wont to say pleadingly
to her other boarders:</p>

<p>“You know what it is—Miss Lillicrap is old, and
then with her heart and all——”</p>

<p>They resented it, but they also were powerless before
those tiny, gnarled hands, that little puckered face
nodding and shaking under a lace cap, and that cracked,
envenomed old voice.</p>

<p>“I wish there was less custard and more pudding,
very often,” said Mr. Bulteel, with a sort of gloomy
humorousness. “It’s always custard.”</p>

<p>“Made with custard powder at that,” put in his wife.</p>

<p>“Eggs are so expensive,” Mrs. Clarence’s habitual
little whine contributed to the quota.</p>

<p>“Not that we don’t pay enough for her to give us
real custard made with eggs,” she added hastily, lest it
should be thought that she was accustomed to economical
shifts.</p>

<p>“Hector,” said his mother sharply, “have you finished
your tea?”</p>

<p>The youth looked resentfully at his parents.</p>

<p>“Go and do your exercises then, my boy,” said his
father firmly.</p>

<p>“All right, father, all right.”</p>

<p>“Now, go at once, Hector,” said Mrs. Bulteel, as
she always said every evening when her son manifested
reluctance with regard to the enforced physical drill,
judged by his parents necessary to the well-being of
their weedy offspring.</p>

<p>“The boy gets hardly any exercise,” his mother discontentedly
informed her neighbour, the Greek, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
contented himself with casting a disparaging eye over
Hector’s lanky proportions, as though he thought it entirely
immaterial whether these were duly developed
or not.</p>

<p>“Wonderful thing, those dumb-bell exercises,” remarked
Mr. Bulteel, shooting a scraggy wrist out of his
coat sleeve, and then withdrawing it again hastily, as
an unsuccessful advertisement. “Hurry up, my boy.”</p>

<p>The door opened again before Hector had responded
in any way to the bracing exhortations of his progenitors.</p>

<p>“Miss Forster back again?” said the Greek gentleman.
“We shall have our game of Bridge before dinner,
then.”</p>

<p>“Don’t move, don’t move!” cried Miss Forster,
breezily putting out a protesting hand very tightly fastened
into a white-kid glove, and thereby obliging Mr.
Bulteel to rise reluctantly from his arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shame!”</p>

<p>Miss Forster sank into the vacated seat immediately,
with a loud sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Have you had a pleasant afternoon with your
friends?” Mrs. Bulteel inquired. She was always inordinately
curious about the social engagements of
other people, but Miss Forster’s garrulousness needed
no questionings.</p>

<p>“A topping afternoon!” she declared with youthful
slanginess. “Never held such cards, either. What do
you think of eight hearts to the Ace, King, Queen?”</p>

<p>The Greek gentleman, to whom she appealed, was
non-committal.</p>

<p>“It depends who was holding them,” he replied laconically.</p>

<p>“Well, I was, of course. My partner’s deal—he’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
gone no trumps; they doubled, and of course I redoubled,
and we made the little slam. Jolly, eh? though
I prefer something with <i>rather</i> more play in it, myself.”</p>

<p>“Such as last night,” grimly suggested the Greek,
in unkind allusion to an incident that Miss Forster
might reasonably be supposed to prefer forgotten.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you forgotten that horrid diamond suit of
yours yet?” cried the lady, shaking an admonitory
forefinger. “It was certainly a slip, and I can’t think
how I came to make it.”</p>

<p>“You took the lead out of your partner’s hand,”
piped Mrs. Clarence, with a sudden display of knowledge
that caused Miss Forster, the recognized Bridge
expert of the house until the Greek gentleman’s recent
arrival, to look at her in astonished resentment.</p>

<p>“I’m not a player, I know,” hastily said Mrs. Clarence,
perhaps in tardy dread lest she also might be reminded
of past fiascos. “Only I always remember that
my husband’s golden rule used to be, ‘Third in hand
plays his highest, and second in hand plays his lowest.’
I’ve never forgotten that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarence’s husband was the only claim to superiority
which she could flaunt before the better-dressed,
better-housed, better-connected, generally better-off
pretensions of Miss Forster and she flaunted
him freely.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was on this account that no one paid the
slightest attention to the <i>mot</i> of the departed card-player.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bulteel picked up the <i>Daily Sketch</i>, and said
without animation, as without any shred of meaning:
“Fancy the Duke of Connaught going to Canada!” and
Mr. Bulteel suddenly exclaimed in shocked tones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“<i>Hector!</i> You won’t have time to do your exercises
before dinner if you don’t go at once.”</p>

<p>The youth slouched from the room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hector should hold himself better!” cried Miss
Forster, who never hesitated to make a remark on the
score of its being a personal one. She flung back
her shoulders as she spoke.</p>

<p>“My son is growing very fast,” said Mrs. Bulteel
stiffly.</p>

<p>Miss Forster laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, I must go and take off my hat.”</p>

<p>She slightly lifted the brim of her large hat, as
though to render her meaning perfectly clear, and left
the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bulteel’s plain, pinched face was further disfigured
by a sneer.</p>

<p>“Poor woman!” she said spitefully. “She really
can’t afford to criticize other people. She gets stouter
every day, I do believe.”</p>

<p>“Is she really such a very good Bridge-player?” Mrs.
Clarence asked, with a sort of restrained eagerness, as
though ashamed of hoping—as she quite obviously did—that
the answer would be in the negative.</p>

<p>“She plays a fair game—<i>for</i> one of your sex,” said
the Greek ungallantly.</p>

<p>It was such small observations as this, which he
let fall from time to time, that made Lydia feel almost
certain that she disliked him, although at other times
she was gratified by his half-covert admiration of her.</p>

<p>Presently the Bulteels went in pursuit of Hector and
his dumb-bells; old Miss Lillicrap tottered off to
scream shrilly for hot water from the top of the kitchen
stairs, and Mrs. Clarence, glancing at Lydia with a
friendly little furtive smirk, sidled out of the room to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
engage upon one of those mysterious futilities that
served to bridge the gaps in the one regular occupation
of her life: her attendance at meals.</p>

<p>Lydia and the Greek were left alone together in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>“The days are drawing in very fast,” he observed,
gazing at the window.</p>

<p>Lydia felt slightly disappointed at the highly impersonal
nature of the remark.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said unenthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Do you find the evenings rather long after you get
in from your work? You very seldom join us in the
drawing-room, I notice, after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I go and sew in Miss Nettleship’s room,
and talk to her,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, no doubt. But are there not evenings
when you retire to your own apartment very early?”</p>

<p>Lydia reflected that foreigners no doubt held views
unshared by the conventional British mind, as to the
propriety of expressing a manifest curiosity in the
affairs of other people.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I have writing to do,” she said shyly.</p>

<p>The admission was not altogether unpremeditated.
Lydia knew that the Greek was an insatiable reader,
mostly of French novels, and it had occurred to her
some time since that he might not unpossibly be of use
in advising her. Besides, she owned to herself quite
frankly, that his interest in her was not likely to be
diminished by the discovery of her literary ambitions.</p>

<p>“I came to London partly so as to be able to write,”
she told him. “I have wanted to write books ever
since I was a child.”</p>

<p>“Ever since you were a child!” he repeated with a
hint of friendly derision. “That is indeed a long while.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
And what form does this writing of yours take? No
doubt you write poetry—all about love, and springtime,
and death?”</p>

<p>Lydia felt herself colouring with annoyance as
she replied with decision:</p>

<p>“Dear me, no. I shouldn’t think of writing poetry
nowadays. I know very well that I can’t. But I’ve
written one or two short stories, and I should like one
day—to write books.”</p>

<p>“Have these stories of yours been published?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” said Lydia. “I haven’t tried to publish
them. I don’t know if they’re the right length, or
where to send them, or anything.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever come across a useful little book
called ‘The Artist and Author’s Handbook?’ That
would give you all the information you require.”</p>

<p>“Would it? I could try and get it,” said Lydia
doubtfully.</p>

<p>She did not want to spend any extra money. There
had proved to be so many unforeseen expenses in
London.</p>

<p>“I think I have a copy. Allow me to lend it to you,”
said the Greek. “It will give you a list of the publishers,
and publications, and a great deal of very
practical information. You should certainly see it. I
will give it to you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!”</p>

<p>“In return,” said the obliging foreigner, with a
slight smile, “may I not be allowed to read one of your
tales?”</p>

<p>Lydia, the intuitive, had been mentally anticipating
the request. She was eager enough for a verdict upon
her work, and only pretended a little modest hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“I am afraid you wouldn’t find them very interesting—but
I should like to know if you think there’s
any hope for me, Mr. ——”</p>

<p>“My name is Margoliouth,” said he.</p>

<p>No one else had ever been honoured by the information.</p>

<p>Lydia went upstairs, discreetly taking upon herself
to break up the <i>tête-à-tête</i>, with increased self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>She was less pleased a few days later when she discovered
that everybody in the boarding-house now
knew that she wrote stories.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit surprised,” Miss Forster cried loudly
and joyously. “I always felt we had a lot in common.
Why, I should write myself if I could only find the
time.”</p>

<p>She traced rapid scribbles in the air with her forefinger.</p>

<p>“It must be a great hobby for you,” said pale Mr.
Bulteel, looking respectfully at Lydia.</p>

<p>“Perhaps one night you’ll read us one of your
stories,” his wife suggested.</p>

<p>She was not usually gracious to the other women
in the house, but Lydia had always listened sympathetically
to her account of the agony that she suffered
from her teeth, now undergoing extensive structural
alterations.</p>

<p>Only little Mrs. Clarence gazed at Lydia with a
thoroughly uneasy eye.</p>

<p>“I must say,” she said with a note of aggression
in her habitual whine, “I do hope you won’t put <i>me</i>
into one of your books, Miss Raymond.”</p>

<p>Lydia enjoyed the attention that was bestowed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
her, even while she critically told herself that it lacked
discernment.</p>

<p>She did not read her stories out loud to the assembled
boarders, as Mrs. Bulteel had suggested, but she
submitted several of them to the inspection of Margoliouth.</p>

<p>“They have merit, and originality,” he told her.
“But your English is not good.”</p>

<p>Lydia held out her hand for the manuscripts without
replying.</p>

<p>“Aha, you think that a foreigner cannot criticize
English,” he said acutely, and interpreting her secret
thought with perfect correctness. “But I assure you
that I am right. Look! you put ‘alright’ for ‘all right’
and ‘She was very interested’ instead of ‘she was very
much interested.’ And again, you have ‘under the circumstances’
for ‘in the circumstances.’ All these are
common errors. Tell me, what authors do you read?”</p>

<p>Lydia was vague. Like the majority of readers, she
chose books almost at random, because the title allured
her, or because someone had said that the story was
exciting.</p>

<p>The Greek shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“The ideas are there,” he said, “but you must learn
to express them better.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt so much mortified that she could hardly
speak. She, the Head of the School at Miss Glover’s,
the owner of the “mathematical mind” so rarely found
in one of her own sex, the responsible and trusted accountant
at Elena’s, to be told that she could not write
English!</p>

<p>At that moment she disliked Margoliouth with all
the cordial dislike accorded to a really candid critic.</p>

<p>Yet it was characteristic of Lydia that, even in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
midst of her vexation, she realized that to display it
would be to destroy much of the Greek’s flattering
opinion of her superior intelligence. She drew a long
breath, and gazed at him frankly and steadily.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” she said. “I must try
and study the really good writers, and—and I’ll remember
what you say, and try and write better English.
I’m sure you’re right.”</p>

<p>It was a little set speech, uttered regardless of the
indignation still burning within her, and it did not fail
of its effect.</p>

<p>“Well done!” cried the Greek softly. “Well done,
Miss Raymond! It is very rare to find so much frankness
and determination in a lady, if I may say so—I
am the more sure that you will eventually succeed.”</p>

<p>Lydia thanked him and took away her manuscripts.</p>

<p>She was inwardly just as angry at his criticism as
she had been on first hearing it, and just as certain
that a foreigner could know nothing about the correctness
or otherwise of her English. But she congratulated
herself on the presence of mind and strength
of will which had enabled her to make so good a show
of open-minded generosity. Quite evidently Margoliouth
thought the better of her for it, and Lydia would
not for the world have forfeited his admiration.</p>

<p>It gave her great <i>prestige</i> in the eyes of the other
boarders.</p>

<p>Lydia knew that they most of them liked her, Mr.
Bulteel because she was young and pretty, his wife,
and whining little Mrs. Clarence, because she always
listened to them sympathetically, all the while inwardly
mindful of Grandpapa’s rule—“<i>Always let the other
people talk about themselves.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Miss Forster liked her too.</p>

<p>Lydia did not exactly flatter Miss Forster, but she
had a tactful way of introducing the topic of Miss
Forster’s great friends, Sir Rupert and Lady Honoret,
and was always ready to hear about the Bridge parties
that Miss Forster frequented at their house in Lexham
Gardens.</p>

<p>Hector Bulteel, the pallid youth whose days were
passed in Gower Street, had at first been too shy even
to speak to Lydia, but one day she asked for his advice
on a point of accountancy, and thereafter they occasionally
discussed the higher mathematics or the distinctions
between organic and inorganic chemistry.</p>

<p>Lydia did not really think very highly of Hector’s
capabilities, but criticized him as shrewdly as she did
everyone else with whom she came into contact.</p>

<p>She was always careful, however, to keep her rather
caustic judgments to herself, and she knew that both
at Madame Elena’s and at the boarding-house the reputation
that had been hers at school still prevailed:
Lydia Raymond never said an unkind thing about
anyone.</p>

<p>Even old Miss Lillicrap, who seldom uttered a
word that was not either spiteful or complaining,
looked at Lydia in a comparatively friendly silence on
the evening that the Greek gentleman first took her to
the Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Lydia wore a new, pale-pink blouse, and her best
dark-brown cloth coat and skirt.</p>

<p>For the first time, she decided that she really <i>was</i>
pretty.</p>

<p>The conviction lent exhilaration to the evening’s entertainment,
which on the whole she found rather dull.
She was not very much amused by the cinematograph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
films displayed, and when, towards the end of the
evening, Mr. Margoliouth fumbled for her hand in
the darkness and held it, Lydia was principally conscious
that hers was still sticky from the chocolates that
he had given her, and failed to derive any thrill from
the experience.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> Christmas time, as the evenings became
shorter and shorter, Mr. Margoliouth developed great
concern at the idea of Lydia’s coming back from her
work alone.</p>

<p>Might he call for her at Madame Elena’s, and
escort her home?</p>

<p>Lydia thanked him very much, and said that one of
her fellow-workers generally came most of the way
with her. But she was not insensible to the flattering
vista thus opened.</p>

<p>The girls at Elena’s would be, in their own parlance,
thrilled if a foreign and interesting-looking male should
make his appearance outside the little shop and await
there the privilege of accompanying Miss Raymond
across the Park.</p>

<p>Gina Ryott boasted a “gentleman friend” who occasionally
paid her the same compliment, and Lydia, as
well as Marguerite Saxon, had peeped through the
closed shutters of the shop window more than once,
in order to watch them depart together.</p>

<p>And not only the girls but the community at the
boarding-house would be full of interest and excitement.</p>

<p>Already Lydia knew perfectly well that Miss Forster
and Mrs. Bulteel exchanged significant glances whilst
she and the Greek talked to one another at meals.</p>

<p>In the trivial monotony of the boarding-house existence,
she even felt certain that Mr. Margoliouth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
his increasingly-marked attentions to herself were the
chief subjects of discussion.</p>

<p>She began to enjoy her position very much, and no
longer held Mr. Margoliouth at a distance. She was
not at all in love with him, but his attentions were very
agreeable and certainly, Lydia told herself, he had
enough discernment to realize that she was not a person
with whom liberties might be taken.</p>

<p>As a fact, his manner towards her was respectful
enough except for a certain tendency towards patting
her wrist, or attracting her attention by a lingering
touch upon her arm or her shoulder.</p>

<p>When they went to a theatre or a cinematograph, he
always held her hand, and a curious sense of fair play
in return for his hospitality induced Lydia to allow this,
and even feebly to return an occasional pressure of her
fingers, although she derived no slightest satisfaction
from the contact.</p>

<p>The rapid development of her mentality had so
far out-distanced other, more human attributes of
youth, that she frequently debated within herself
whether Mr. Margoliouth was ever likely to try and
kiss her. If so, Lydia reflected with cold self-righteousness,
she would rebuke him in such fashion that he
would respect and admire her more than ever. She
was full of instinctive horror at the idea of “making
herself cheap,” and it had been inculcated into her both
by Aunt Beryl and Aunt Evelyn that to do so was to
invite disaster of some unspecified but terrible kind.</p>

<p>When her Christmas holiday was approaching—two
days and a half which she was to spend at Regency
Terrace—Lydia began to mention the Greek occasionally
in her weekly letter to Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>She was not averse from some slight exploitation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
her first conquest, and moreover she thought it quite
likely that a hint might reach Aunt Beryl any day
through Miss Nettleship, and she wisely preferred to
secure herself against any charge of secretiveness.</p>

<p>At first Aunt Beryl only wrote back, “Glad you enjoyed
yourself at the Polytechnic, dear; mind and not
take cold coming out from those hot places this bitter
weather.” Then later: “This Mr. Margoliouth seems
very attractive. Don’t let him break your little heart,
dear!”</p>

<p>The two notes of exclamation denoted Aunt Beryl’s
humorous intention, as Lydia well knew. But one day
she wrote more seriously.</p>

<p>“I must say it would be a real pleasure to hear you
were properly engaged, providing it was to some really
nice fellow. Don’t be in a hurry to decide though, dear—you’re
very young.”</p>

<p>Lydia herself had hardly contemplated the possibility
of an engagement. But now she began to wonder
whether or no any such idea held a place in Margoliouth’s
mind. He had certainly said that he should
like to show her his own country, and told her how
much she would enjoy a sea voyage and how greatly
the new experience of travelling would help her to
write.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he continued to take her out two or three
times a week, and to give her expensive boxes of chocolates
and occasional books.</p>

<p>The girls at Madame Elena’s became aware of him,
and chaffed Lydia agreeably, and at the boarding-house
Miss Forster, always outspoken, one day asked whether
she had ordered her wedding-dress yet.</p>

<p>Lydia did not like Miss Forster’s blatancy, but her
old predilection for finding herself the heroine of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
surroundings was stronger than ever, and it gratified
her to know that they were all watching her and wondering
what would happen to her next.</p>

<p>A less agreeable manifestation of interest was, however,
in store for her.</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship sought her out apologetic but conscientious.</p>

<p>“You know how it is, dear, I know—but really I do
feel responsible to your auntie, just a wee bit—and I
feel I really must say something. They’re all talking
about it, you know—not saying anything, I don’t mean
of course, but you know—just talking, like.”</p>

<p>The distinction that Miss Nettleship wished to imply
between the saying of anything and mere talking about
it, was perfectly clear to the resentful and embarrassed
Lydia.</p>

<p>True to her instincts, however, she showed none of
the resentment and as little as she could of the embarrassment.</p>

<p>“There really isn’t anything for anyone to talk
about. Mr. Margoliouth is very fond of the theatre,
he says, and he hasn’t anyone to go with him. It’s
very kind of him to take me, I think.”</p>

<p>“Once here and there,” said Miss Nettleship distractedly,
“but really, dear, it’s getting more than that,
and of course it’s a bit conspicuous because of his
never hardly taking any notice of anyone else. At
the Bridge now, when they play in the evenings, he’s
downright uncivil to poor Mrs. Clarence, and I’ve
heard him very rude to Miss Forster too, though of
course she’s well able to hold her own. But it makes
it all the more marked, his going on the way he does
with you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help his liking me,” said Lydia meekly, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
inwardly rather gratified at Miss Nettleship’s artless
exposition of the distinction that she enjoyed.</p>

<p>“Now don’t go thinking I’m blaming you for an
instant, dear. I know very well that your auntie’s
brought you up to be careful, and, besides, I can see for
myself you’re steady—not one of those girls I call
regular <i>flirts</i>. But it’s your being so young, and there’s
something else too.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship hesitated, her pleasant, anxious-looking
face much discomposed.</p>

<p>“Really I oughtn’t to say anything about it to you,
but you do understand how it is, dear—I feel the
responsibility of having you here, and your auntie
being such a friend of mine and everything, I feel I
can’t let it go on and not say anything.”</p>

<p>“I’ve written to Aunt Beryl all about Mr. Margoliouth,
you know,” said Lydia quickly.</p>

<p>She felt the announcement to be a trump card, and
was surprised that Miss Nettleship’s harassed expression
did not relax.</p>

<p>“I was sure you would, dear—it isn’t that. You see
the fact is, though I oughtn’t to mention it but I know
you can be trusted never to pass it on,—the fact is that
Mr. Margoliouth, as he calls himself, isn’t altogether
sound, and I don’t know that I shan’t have to ask him
to leave.”</p>

<p>“Why?” cried Lydia, astonished.</p>

<p>But Miss Nettleship had her own methods of imparting
information, and was not to be hustled out of
them.</p>

<p>“Of course you know how it is in a place like this—one
has to be very particular, and I’ve always asked
for references and everything, and there’s never been
any trouble except just once, right at the start. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
was with foreigners, too, a pair of Germans, and called
themselves brother and sister. However, that’s nothing
to do with you, dear, and I had to send them packing
very quickly—in fact, the minute I had any doubts
at all. It’s the ruin of a place like this ever to let it get
a name, as you can imagine, and the fright I got then
made me more particular than ever. This fellow Margoliouth
gave me a City reference, and another a clergyman
somewhere up in Yorkshire, and paid his first
week in advance. And since then it’s just been one
put off after another.”</p>

<p>“But how—what do you mean, Miss Nettleship?”</p>

<p>“He’s not paying his way,” said the manageress,
fixing her brown eyes compassionately upon Lydia’s
face.</p>

<p>“He asked me to let him have his account monthly,
as it was more convenient, and I gave in, although it’s
not my rule, and I wouldn’t have that old Miss Lillicrap—you
know what she is, dear, and how one can’t go
against her—I wouldn’t have her hear about it for the
world. Well, it was seven weeks before he paid me
the first month, and I had to ask him for it again and
again. He said there was some difficulty about getting
his money from Greece paid into the Bank here. However,
he paid in the end, but since then it’s been nothing
but putting off and putting off—would I let it stand
over for a week because it wasn’t convenient, and so
on and so on. I told him he’d have to get his meals out
if it went on, and then he gave me something on account—but
not a third of what he owes me, dear. I really
don’t know what to do about it. He’s so plausible, I half
believe it’s all right when he’s talking to me, but I
can’t afford to go on like this. He’ll have to go if he
hasn’t paid in full at the end of this week. And how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
I’m to get the money back if he doesn’t pay up I really
don’t know, for a prosecution would be a fearful business
for me, and lose me every boarder in the place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would be dreadful!” cried Lydia, sincerely
shocked. “But he <i>must</i> pay. I thought of him as quite
rich.”</p>

<p>“So you might, from the way he goes on. And the
bills that are always coming for him, too!” said Miss
Nettleship.</p>

<p>“I can’t help seeing them, you know, when I clear
the box in the mornings. However, he says there’s
money coming to him from Greece, and it’s only got to
be put into his Bank over here, and he can promise me
a cheque on Saturday at latest. So I’m not saying any
more till then, but <i>after</i> that my mind’s made up. But
you’ll understand, dear, why I felt I had to speak to
you about it first.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt that she understood only too well, and
she went to business next morning in so thoughtful a
mood that Rosie Graham, whose observation nothing
escaped, made sharp inquiry of her as they snatched
a ten minutes’ tea-interval in the afternoon: “What’s
up that you’re going about with a face as long as a
fiddle?”</p>

<p>In the midst of her perfectly real preoccupation, it
was not in Lydia to fail to perceive her opportunity for
at last arousing a tardy interest in Miss Graham.</p>

<p>“I’m worried,” she said frankly.</p>

<p>“Worry won’t mend matters,” quoted Rosie tritely,
but Lydia reaped the advantage of her invariable abstention
from the airing of daily minor grievances such
as the other girls brought to their work, in the instant
acceptance of her statement shown by the astute little
Cockney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Come round to my place for a yarn this evening,”
she suggested. “My pal’s out and I can find some food,
I daresay, though it won’t be seven courses and a powdered
footman behind the chair, like that place of
yours.”</p>

<p>Lydia accepted, and felt flattered. No one else
had ever been asked to Rosie’s place.</p>

<p>They took a Sloane Street omnibus at six o’clock,
and got out at Sloane Square, where Lydia made use
of a public telephone to inform Miss Nettleship that she
would not be in to supper, and then Rosie led her
through a very large square, a mews, and into a little
street called Walton Street. They crossed it, and
entered Ovington Street.</p>

<p>“Number ninety-one A,” said Miss Graham, producing
a latch-key.</p>

<p>She took Lydia to the top of the house, and Lydia
was astounded at the lightness and airiness of the fair-sized
room, with a much smaller one opening out of
it, evidently in use as a dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Not so dusty, is it?” Rosie said complacently.
“This sofa turns into a bed, and there’s another proper
bed in the other room. The whole thing—unfurnished—costs
us twenty-two and six a week, and includes
everything except the use of the gas. There’s a penny-in-the-slot
machine for that. We do most of our
cooking on the gas-ring, but the landlady’s very decent
about sometimes letting us use the kitchen fire.”</p>

<p>She gave Lydia a supper of sausage-rolls, bread-and-butter,
cocoa and a variety of sweet cakes and biscuits,
and all the time talked more agreeably and less caustically
than Lydia had ever heard her talk before.</p>

<p>When the little meal was over and the table pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
out of the way, Rosie made Lydia draw her chair close
to the tiny oil-stove.</p>

<p>“There’s a gas-fire,” she said frankly, “but we don’t
use it unless the weather’s simply perishing. It’s rather
an expensive luxury. Sure you’re all right like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. What a lot of heat this thing gives
out!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it? Well, now,” said Miss Graham abruptly,
“spit it out. What’s all the trouble? Is it anything
to do with that foreign freak who stands about
waiting for you outside Elena’s of an evening sometimes?”</p>

<p>Lydia was too well inured to the shop-girl vocabulary
to resent this description of her admirer.</p>

<p>She decided that she would allow herself the luxury
of contravening Grandpapa’s rule, and for once talk
about herself, justified in doing so by her conviction
that it was the only short cut to the rousing in Miss
Rosie Graham of that interest which Lydia still desired
the more keenly from the very ease with which she
could command it in others.</p>

<p>She told her story, but omitted all mention of Miss
Nettleship’s confidences.</p>

<p>“My aunt, who brought me up, knows a little about
it—I wrote and told her he was taking me out sometimes—and
she said in a letter I had from her the other
day that it would be so nice if I got engaged. Somehow,
you know, I hadn’t really thought of that before.
But I’ve been rather worried since, wondering whether
perhaps he means to ask me. If so, I suppose I
oughtn’t to let him go about with me quite so much
unless I make up my mind to say ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>Lydia was aware that she had stated her problem
one-sidedly, for her real preoccupation was whether or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
no Margoliouth was going to pay her the compliment
of a proposal. But the temptation to represent herself
as merely undecided if she should become engaged to
him or not, was irresistible.</p>

<p>She thought that Rosie looked at her rather curiously
as she finished speaking.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you’re always about with him and let
him give you presents and all the rest of it, the poor
Johnnie’s bound to think you mean business,” she said
slowly. “But you’d better be careful, kid. Are you
so sure that he wants to marry you?”</p>

<p>Lydia felt herself colouring hotly, sufficiently understanding
the older girl’s implication to resent it.</p>

<p>“I should think Mr. Margoliouth is too much of a
man of the world not to see for himself the sort of girl <i>I</i>
am,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>“He can see for himself that you’re only a silly kid,
if that’s what you mean,” retorted the outspoken Rosie
Graham. “Tell me, where does this Margoliouth, or
whatever he calls himself, come from? He’s as black
as my hat, anyway.”</p>

<p>Lydia began to wish that she had never embarked
upon the path of confidences at all.</p>

<p>“He is Greek,” she said very stiffly.</p>

<p>“That might mean anything,” retorted Miss Graham
sweepingly. “I tell you frankly that’s what I don’t
like about the business—his being such a rum colour.
I don’t trust black fellows.”</p>

<p>“You talk as though he were a nigger!” said Lydia,
furious.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m talking about. I knew a girl once
who took up with a fellow like that. He wasn’t a bit
darker than your Margoliouth, and he talked awfully
good English, and she got herself engaged to him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
said he was a prince, and frightfully rich, and he gave
her all sorts of presents, and when he had to go back
to his own country he sent her the money for her
passage so she could come out next year and get married
to him. Well, she got everything ready—heaps of
clothes and things—and was always talking of how she
was going to be a princess, and he’d promised to meet
her at a place called Port Said with his own carriage
and horses and all the rest of it. Some of us thought
she was taking a bit of a risk, but she didn’t care a
scrap, and was just wild to get out there. Well, off she
went—and we didn’t hear anything more about her, or
get any of the letters and photographs and things she’d
promised to send. And then three months later, I met
her in the City, where I was matching silks for old
Peroxide, and she’d sneaked back to her old firm and
got them to take her back as typist again.”</p>

<p>“But what had happened?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell me, and I didn’t ask her. But she
told another girl, and I heard about it afterwards.
She’d gone off on the ship all right, with all her fine
new luggage and the rest of it, and she’d told all the
people on board who she was going out to marry, and
most of them said what a fool she was, and it would
be an awful life for an English girl, and she’d never
be allowed to come home again. But there was one
man on board—a parson—who simply wouldn’t let her
alone about it, and said she didn’t know what she was
doing, and at last he got her to promise that she
wouldn’t actually marry this chap until he’d made
inquiries about him. And he did the minute they
arrived—although the fellow was there just as he’d
said, with a great carriage and two horses, to take
her away. I don’t exactly know what happened, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
this clergyman fellow went straight off to some British
Consul or someone, and they found out all about the
man straight away. He <i>was</i> a sort of prince all right,
and quite as rich as he’d said—though he didn’t live
in a palace, but some place right away from everywhere—but
he wasn’t a Christian—and <i>he’d got two
native wives already</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lydia gasped involuntarily at the climax of
the narrative, which came upon her inexperience as a
complete shock.</p>

<p>“So that was the end of <i>that</i>, as you can imagine,”
said Miss Graham. “The clergyman was awfully good
to her, and paid her passage home again out of his own
pocket, because she hadn’t got a sixpence. Poor kid,
she was fearfully cut up, though as a matter of fact
she ought to have been off her head with thankfulness
that she got stopped in time. I don’t suppose she’d ever
have got away again, once he’d taken her off in his
carriage and pair.”</p>

<p>“It must have been awful for her, going back to her
old job, after leaving it to get married like that,” said
Lydia. She thought with horror of the humiliation
that it would mean for the victim to return, in such
circumstances, to those who had doubtless heard her
triumphant boasts of emancipation on leaving.</p>

<p>“D’you think that would be the worst of it?” queried
Miss Graham sharply.</p>

<p>Lydia, failing to see the drift of the question, answered
unhesitatingly:</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it would. It’s the part <i>I</i> should have
minded most.”</p>

<p>A guilty remembrance flashed across her mind of
yet another axiom of Grandpapa’s—“Don’t refer everything
back to yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>She wished that she had remembered it earlier, when
Rosie looked at her strangely, and then said:</p>

<p>“I believe you <i>would</i> mind that most—what other
people would say and think about you, I mean. What
an inhuman kid you are!”</p>

<p>Lydia felt almost more bewildered than offended.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anybody you care for beside yourself?”
said Rosie Graham slowly. “I’ve been watching you
ever since you came to us. Of course you’re very clever,
and a cut above the rest of us—I know all that—and
you’re awfully sweet and nice to everybody, and never
say cattish things about anyone—but what’s it all <i>for</i>?
You don’t care a damn for anybody that I can see. And
then you talk about this chap who’s going with you—this
Margoliouth—and whether he wants you to be
engaged or not. And I don’t believe you’ve once
thought whether you could care for him, or he for you.
Why, this girl I was telling you about was crazy about
her fellow. <i>That</i> was what broke her up—not the
having made a fool of herself, and wondering if the
others at her old shop weren’t laughing at her. But
that’s simply beyond you, isn’t it? I don’t believe you
know what caring for anybody means.”</p>

<p>The two girls looked at one another in silence.</p>

<p>Rosie’s accusation not only came as a shock to Lydia,
but it carried with it an inward conviction that was
disconcerting in the extreme.</p>

<p>Lydia, no coward, faced the unpalatable truth, and
instinctively and instantly accepted it as such.</p>

<p>She wondered, with the curious analytical detachment
characteristic of the self-centred, that she had
never seen it for herself. It vexed her that it should
have been left to little Rosie Graham’s penetration to
enlighten her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>She rallied her forces. Rosie should at least see
in her the saving grace of a courageous candour.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s true,” she said slowly. “I’ve been
first with one set of people, and then with another,
since I was a small child, and perhaps I’ve got into a
calculating way of just trying to please them, so that
they should be nice to me. I don’t know that I’m really
particularly fond of any of them....”</p>

<p>She passed in mental review as she spoke those with
whom her short life had been most nearly connected.</p>

<p>Her parents.</p>

<p>She could hardly remember her father, and she had
certainly never loved her mother, weak where Lydia,
at twelve years old, was already hard, irrationally impulsive
where Lydia was calculating, sentimental where
Lydia was contemptuous. Looking back, she realized
that her mother had done her best to make Lydia as
feebly emotional as she was herself, and that Lydia’s
own clear-sightedness had not only saved her, but had
also forced upon her a very thorough reaction.</p>

<p>Grandpapa—Aunt Beryl—Uncle George—she
thought of them all. Certainly she was fond of them
in a way, and Grandpapa she most sincerely admired
and respected, more than anyone she knew.</p>

<p>She was grateful to Aunt Beryl and Uncle George,
and anxious to do them credit, but her interest in their
welfare was not excessive. If she heard of their deaths
that evening, Lydia knew very well that her chief pang
would be remorse for a complete absence of acute
sorrow.</p>

<p>There was Nathalie Palmer.</p>

<p>At school, Nathalie had adored her. She still wrote
her long, intimate letters full of personal details which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Lydia could not help thinking rather trivial and unnecessary.</p>

<p>But because one criticized, that did not preclude a
certain degree of affection. Lydia was certainly fond
of Nathalie.</p>

<p>She did not for an instant, however, pretend either
to herself or to Rosie Graham, that the latter’s words
were unjustified by fact.</p>

<p>“I’m certainly not at all in love with Mr. Margoliouth
now,” she said, “but there’s no reason why I
shouldn’t be later on, I suppose. And because it’s more
or less true that I’ve never cared a very great deal for
anybody so far, it doesn’t follow that I never shall.
I’m not twenty yet.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s hope for you,” said Rosie Graham
grudgingly. “But I’m very sorry for you when you
once <i>do</i> begin to care for somebody—I don’t mind who
it may be.”</p>

<p>Lydia was conscious of feeling rather flattered by
the interpretation she put upon the words.</p>

<p>“I suppose that all one’s eggs in one basket is always
a risk,” she said, not without complacency.</p>

<p>Rosie gave a short, staccato laugh, and again shot one
of her disconcerting glances at her visitor.</p>

<p>“What <i>I</i> mean is that you’ll do it so jolly badly.
You’ve never cared for anybody but yourself, and you
won’t even know how to begin.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better be sorry for the person I care
for,” said Lydia drily.</p>

<p>She was in reality very angry, and she rose to go for
fear of betraying it.</p>

<p>“I daresay it’s rather beastly of me to have said that,
when I’ve asked you here to spend the evening,” said
Rosie with a certain compunction in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“I’m very glad you said what you thought,” Lydia
returned calmly. “Good night, and thanks for having
me.”</p>

<p>“Good night. And I say—<i>don’t</i> do anything in a
hurry about that coloured friend of yours.”</p>

<p>Lydia walked downstairs and out of the front door
without deigning any reply to this last, urgent piece of
advice.</p>

<p>As she sat in the jolting, nearly empty omnibus that
was to take her as far as Southampton Row, she reviewed
Rosie Graham’s speeches of the evening.</p>

<p>It was quite true, Lydia supposed, that she did not
really care for anybody but herself. She was too clear-sighted
to pretend that this distressed her. On the contrary,
she realized the immense simplification of a life
into which no seriously conflicting claims could enter.</p>

<p>After all it had taken the almost uncanny acumen of
a Rosie Graham to discover the fundamental egotism
that underlay all Lydia’s careful courtesy and studied
kindness of word and deed.</p>

<p>She was annoyed that Rosie should have so poor an
opinion of her, but Rosie was only one person; and
though in Lydia’s present surroundings she held rank
of high importance, the importance was merely relative.</p>

<p>The day would come when Rosie Graham, and what
Rosie Graham thought, whether true or otherwise,
would matter not at all to Lydia Raymond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless</span>, Rosie Graham’s anecdote of the girl
who had gone to Port Said, and her vehement advice
to have nothing to do with the Greek, continued to
haunt Lydia’s mind.</p>

<p>Neither had she forgotten Miss Nettleship’s warning,
and the sense that the manageress was watching
her with melancholy anxiety caused her to surmise
that Mr. Margoliouth had not yet made good his assurance
of payment.</p>

<p>She refused an invitation to go to the play with
him, but was too anxious that the boarders should continue
to look upon her as the heroine of an exciting love-affair
to discourage him altogether, although she had
really made up her mind that she should not care to
be engaged to Margoliouth.</p>

<p>If the first man who had made her acquaintance
since she left school showed so much tendency to make
love to her, Lydia shrewdly told herself, there would
certainly be others. She could well afford to wait, in
the certainty of eventually finding a man who would
possess such attractions and advantages as the Greek
could not boast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Margoliouth made life interesting, and
Lydia a subject of universal observation and discussion.</p>

<p>She was feeling agreeably conscious of this on the
Saturday following her conversation with the manageress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
as she came into the boarding-house in time for
the midday meal.</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship was hovering at the foot of the stairs
and failed to return Lydia’s smile.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to go,” she said without preliminary. “I
got his cheque, and the Bank has returned it. You see
how it is, dear—a terrible business. I don’t know
whether I shan’t have to call the police in even now
before I get my money. He’s leaving on Monday, and
if I’ve not had the cash down from him, I don’t know
what’ll happen, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Nettleship, how dreadful! I <i>am</i> sorry
for you,” said Lydia, giving expression to the surface
emotion of her mind only, from habit and instinct
alike.</p>

<p>“Don’t you have anything more to do with him,
dear,” said Miss Nettleship distractedly. “That Agnes
is letting something burn downstairs. I can smell it as
plain as anything. I’ll have to go. Poor old Agnes!
she means well but you quite understand how it is——”</p>

<p>The manageress hastened down the stairs to the basement.</p>

<p>Lydia could not help glancing at her neighbour in
the dining-room with a good deal of anxiety. He
seemed quite imperturbable, and said nothing about his
departure.</p>

<p>Lydia, whose opinion of Miss Nettleship’s mentality
was not an exalted one, began to think that Mr. Margoliouth
knew quite well that he could pay his bills before
Monday, and had no intention of going away at all.</p>

<p>Otherwise, why was he not more uneasy? Far from
uneasy, Margoliouth seemed to be livelier than usual,
paid Lydia one or two small compliments with his
usual half-condescending, half-sardonic expression, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
asked her if she would come out to tea with him that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Miss Nettleship was on one of her periodical excursions
to the kitchen, and Miss Forster, Mrs. Clarence,
and Mrs. Bulteel were listening with all their ears, and
with as detached an expression as each could contrive
to assume.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, I should like to,” said Lydia
demurely.</p>

<p>They went to a newly-opened corner shop in Piccadilly,
where a small orchestra was playing, and little
shaded pink lights stood upon all the tables. The contrast
with the foggy December dusk outside struck
pleasantly upon Lydia’s imagination, and she enjoyed
herself, and was talkative and animated.</p>

<p>Margoliouth stared at her with his unwinking black
gaze, and when they had finished tea he left his chair,
and came to sit beside her on the low plush sofa, that
had its back to the wall.</p>

<p>“A girl like you shouldn’t go about London alone,”
he suddenly remarked, with a sort of unctuousness.
“At least, not until she knows something about life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can take care of myself,” said Lydia hastily.</p>

<p>“But you don’t know the dangers that a young girl
of your attraction is exposed to,” he persisted. “You
don’t know what sort of brutes men can be, do you?”</p>

<p>“No girl need ever be annoyed—unless she <i>wants</i>
to be,” quoted Lydia primly from Aunt Beryl’s wisdom.</p>

<p>“You think so, do you? Now, I wonder if you’ll
still say that in three years’ time. Do you know that
you are the sort of woman to make either a very good
saint or a very good sinner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>The world-old lure was too potent for Lydia’s
youth and her vanity.</p>

<p>“Am I?” she said eagerly. “Sometimes I’ve thought
that, too.”</p>

<p>The Greek put his hand upon her, slipping his arm
through hers in his favourite manner.</p>

<p>“Tell me about your little self, won’t you?” he said
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>“<i>Always let the other people talk about themselves.</i>”</p>

<p>Oh, inconvenient and ill-timed recollection of
Grandpapa’s high, decisive old voice! So vividly was
it forced upon the ear of Lydia’s unwilling memory
that she could almost have believed herself at Regency
Terrace once more. The illusion checked her eager,
irrepressible grasp at the opportunity held out by the
foreigner. The game was spoilt.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell,” she said abruptly, suddenly
grown weary.</p>

<p>Grandpapa had said that long stories about oneself
always bored other people, whether or no they politely
affected an appearance of interest.</p>

<p>No doubt it was true.</p>

<p>Lydia knew that she herself was not apt to take any
very real interest, for instance, in Nathalie Palmer’s
long letters about her home, and the parish, and the
new experiment of keeping hens at the vicarage, nor
in the many stories, all of them personal, told by the
girls at Elena’s, nor even in the monotonous recital of
Miss Nettleship’s difficulties with her servants.</p>

<p>Why should the Greek be interested in hearing
Lydia’s opinion of Lydia?</p>

<p>She cynically determined that it would not be worth
while to put him to the test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Let’s go home,” she said.</p>

<p>Margoliouth raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I suppose that all women are capricious.”</p>

<p>His use of the word “women,” as applied to her
nineteen-year-old self, always insensibly flattered
Lydia.</p>

<p>She let him take her back to the Bloomsbury boarding-house
in a hansom, and remained passive, although
unresponsive, when he put his arm round her, and
pressed her against him in the narrow confinement of
the cab.</p>

<p>“Dear little girl!” sighed Margoliouth sentimentally,
as he reluctantly released her from his clasp when the
cab stopped.</p>

<p>Lydia ran up the steps, agreeably surprised at the
instant opening of the door, and anxious to exchange
the raw and foggy atmosphere outside for the comparative
warmth and light of the hall.</p>

<p>The dining-room door also stood open, and as Lydia
came in Miss Forster rushed out upon her.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you!” she cried effusively.
“Come in here, my dear, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Into the dining-room?” said Lydia, amazed. “Why,
there’s no fire there! I’m going upstairs.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Miss Forster still more urgently, and
laying a tightly-gloved white-kid hand on Lydia’s arm.
“There’s someone up there.”</p>

<p>She pointed mysteriously to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Lydia looked up, bewildered, but only saw Miss Nettleship,
the gas-light shining full on her pale, troubled
face, hastening down the stairs. She passed Lydia and
Miss Forster unperceiving, and went straight up to the
Greek, who had just closed the street door behind
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Mr. Margoliouth!” she said, in her usual breathless
fashion. “You see how it is—it’s quite all right, I’m
sure ... but your wife has come. She’s in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Margoliouth uttered a stifled exclamation, and then
went upstairs without another word.</p>

<p>Miss Forster almost dragged Lydia into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“There! Of course you didn’t know he was married,
did you? Neither did any of us, and I must say I think
he’s behaved abominably.”</p>

<p>“But who is she? When did she come?” asked
Lydia, still wholly bewildered at the suddenness of the
revelation.</p>

<p>“Sit down, and I’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>Miss Forster settled her ample person in a chair, with
a general expression of undeniable satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Just about half an hour after you’d left the house,
I was just wondering if I should find dear Lady Honoret
at home if I ran round—you know my great
friends, Sir Rupert and Lady Honoret. I’m sure I’ve
often mentioned them; they’re quite well-known people—but
I thought, of course, there wouldn’t be a chance
of finding them disengaged—she’s always <i>somewhere</i>—so
Mrs. Bulteel and I were settling down to a nice,
cosy time over the fire. Irene had actually made up
quite a good fire, for once. And then the door opened”—Miss
Forster flung open an invisible portal with
characteristic energy—“and in comes Miss Nettleship—and
I remember thinking to myself at the time, in a
sort of flash, you know: Miss Nettleship looks <i>pale</i>—a
sort of startled look—it just flashed through my mind.
And this woman was just behind her.”</p>

<p>“What is she like?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Lydia was conscious of disappointment and humiliation,
but she was principally aware of extreme curiosity.</p>

<p>“Just what you’d expect,” said Miss Forster, with a
decisiveness that somehow mitigated the extremely
cryptic nature of the description. “The moment I saw
her and realized who she was—and I’m bound to say
Miss Nettleship spoke her name <i>at once</i>—that moment
I said to myself that she was just what I should have
expected her to be.”</p>

<p>Lydia, less eager for details of Miss Forster’s remarkable
prescience than for further information, still
looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Dark, you know,” said Miss Forster. “Very dark—and
stout.”</p>

<p>She described a circle of immense and improbable
width. “Older than he is, I should say—without a
doubt. And wearing a white veil, and one of those
foreign-looking black hats tilted right over her eyes—you
know the sort of thing. And boots—buttoned
boots. With a check costume—exactly like a foreigner.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she <i>is</i> a foreigner.”</p>

<p>“I spoke in French at once,” said Miss Forster. “It
was most awkward, of course—and I could see that
Mrs. Bulteel was completely taken aback. Not much
<i>savoir faire</i> there, between ourselves, is there? But, of
course, as a woman of the world, I spoke up at once,
the moment Miss Nettleship performed the introduction.
‘<i>Comment vous trouvez-vous, M’dahme?</i>’ I said.
Of course, not shaking hands—simply bowing.”</p>

<p>“What did she say?” Lydia asked breathlessly, as
Miss Forster straightened herself with a little gasp,
after a stiff but profound inclination of her person
from the waist downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“She answered in English. She has an accent, of
course—doesn’t speak nearly as well as he does. Something
about us knowing her husband. ‘Do you mean
Mr. Margoliouth?’ I said. Naughty of me, though,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very,” said Lydia hastily. “But what did she
say?”</p>

<p>“Took it quite seriously,” crowed Miss Forster, suddenly
convulsed. “Really, some people have <i>no</i> sense
of the ludicrous. I said it for a bit of mischief, you
know. ‘Do you mean Mr. Margoliouth?’ I said—and
she answered me quite solemnly, ‘Yes, of course.’”</p>

<p>Then it really was Margoliouth’s wife. Lydia began
to realize the fact that until now had carried no sort of
conviction to her mind.</p>

<p>Margoliouth, a married man, had been making a
fool of her before all these people. Such was the
aspect of her case that flashed across her with sudden,
furious indignation.</p>

<p>She perceived that Miss Forster was looking at her
with curiosity.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that he was married at all,” said
Lydia calmly.</p>

<p>“No one could have guessed it for a moment, and
he never gave us a hint,” said Miss Forster indignantly.
“You won’t mind me saying, dear, that I wanted to
get you in here and tell you quietly before you went up
and found her there, sitting on the sofa as calm as you
please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Lydia. “But really, you know, it
doesn’t matter to me if Mr. Margoliouth <i>is</i> married.
Only I think he ought to have told Miss Nettleship,
and—and all of us.”</p>

<p>“The cad!” cried Miss Forster energetically, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
striking the rather tight lap of her silk dress with a
violence that threatened to split the white-kid glove.
“What we women have to put up with, I always say!
Only a man could behave like that, and what can we
do to defend ourselves? Nothing at all. I was telling
Sir Rupert Honoret the other day—those friends of
mine who live in Lexham Gardens, you know—I was
telling him what I thought of the whole sex. Oh, I’ve
the courage of my opinions, I know. Men are brutes—there’s
no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he didn’t expect her here?” said Lydia
dreamily, still referring to the Margoliouth <i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Forster understood.</p>

<p>“Not he! You saw what a fool he looked when the
manageress told him she was here. She’s come to
fetch him away, that’s what it is. She as good as said
so. But they’ll be here till Monday morning, I’m
afraid—the pair of them. Ugh!——” Miss Forster
gave a most realistic shudder. “I don’t know how I
shall sit at table with them. Miss Nettleship has no
business to take in people of that sort—she ought to
have made inquiries about the man in the first place,
and I shall tell her so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Lydia gently. “Please don’t. She’ll
be so upset at the whole thing already.”</p>

<p>“Very generous!” Miss Forster declared, her hand
pressed heavily on Lydia’s shoulder. “Of course, it’s
you one can’t help thinking of—a young girl like you.
Oh, the cad! If I were a man, I’d horsewhip a fellow
like that.”</p>

<p>She indulged in a vigorous illustrative pantomime.</p>

<p>“I shall be all right,” Lydia said quickly—insensibly
adopting the most dignified attitude at her command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>She moved to the door.</p>

<p>“Have some supper sent up to your room, do,” urged
Miss Forster. “I’m sure Irene would get a tray ready,
and I’ll bring it up to you myself. Then you won’t
have to come down to the dining-room.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, but I’d rather come down.”</p>

<p>Lydia was speaking literal truth, as, with her usual
clear-sightedness, she soon began to realize.</p>

<p>Not only was her curiosity undeniably strong, both
to behold the recent arrival, and to observe Margoliouth’s
behaviour in these new and undoubtedly disconcerting
circumstances—but it was slowly borne in
upon her that she could not afford to relinquish the
opportunity of standing in the lime-light with the attention
of her entire audience undeviatingly fixed upon
herself.</p>

<p>Her humiliation could be turned into a triumph.</p>

<p>Lydia set her teeth.</p>

<p>She had been very angry with Margoliouth, and was
so still—less because he had deceived her than because
the discovery of his deceit must destroy all her prestige
as the youthful recipient of exclusive attentions. But
after all, she could still be the heroine of this boarding-house
drama.</p>

<p>Lydia reflected grimly that there were more ways
than one of being a heroine.</p>

<p>She looked at herself in the glass. Anger and excitement
had given her a colour, and she did not feel at all
inclined to cry. She was, in fact, perfectly aware that
she was really not in the least unhappy. But the people
downstairs would think that she was proudly concealing
a broken heart.</p>

<p>Lydia dressed her thick mass of hair very carefully,
thrust the high, carved comb into one side of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
black twist at just the right angle, and put on a blouse
of soft, dark-red silk that suited her particularly well.</p>

<p>There was a knock at her door.</p>

<p>Lydia went to open it, and saw Miss Nettleship on
the threshold.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, I am so sorry, and if you want a
tray upstairs for this once, it’ll be quite all right, and
I’ll give the girl the order myself. You aren’t thinking
of coming down to-night, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said Lydia steadily. “It’s very kind
of you, but I’d rather come down just as usual.”</p>

<p>“It’s as you like, of course,” said the manageress in
unhappy accents. “Miss Forster came to me about you—you
know what she is. But I’m so vexed you should
have heard all in a minute like, only you understand
how it was, dear, don’t you? And his wife has paid
up the bills, all in cash, and wants to stay over Sunday.”</p>

<p>“There’s the bell,” said Lydia.</p>

<p>“Then I must go, dear—you know how it is. That
old Miss Lillicrap is such a terror with the vegetables.
I do feel so vexed about it all—and your auntie will be
upset, won’t she? Are you ready, dear?”</p>

<p>Lydia saw that the kind woman was waiting to accompany
her downstairs to the dining-room, but she
had every intention of making her entrance unescorted.</p>

<p>“I’m not quite ready,” she said coolly. “Please
don’t wait—I know you want to be downstairs.”</p>

<p>The manageress looked bewildered, and as though
she felt herself to have been rebuffed, but she spoke in
her usual rather incoherently good-natured fashion as
she hastened down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Just whatever you like, and it’ll be quite all right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
I quite understand. I wish I could wait, dear, but really
I daren’t....”</p>

<p>Lydia was very glad that Miss Nettleship dared not
wait.</p>

<p>She herself remained upstairs for another full five
minutes, although her remaining preparations were
easily completed in one.</p>

<p>At the end of the five minutes she felt sure that all
the boarders must be assembled. Hardly anyone was
ever late for a meal, since meals for most of the
women, at any rate, contributed the principal variety
in the day’s occupation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lydia went downstairs very slowly,
until the sound of clattering plates and dishes, broken
by occasional outbreaks of conversation, told her that
dinner was in progress.</p>

<p>Then she quickly opened the dining-room door.</p>

<p>They were all there, and they all looked up as she
came in.</p>

<p>Her accustomed seat at the far end of the table, next
to the Greek, was empty, but on Margoliouth’s other
side sat a strange woman, whom Lydia was at no pains
to identify, even had Miss Forster’s description not at
once returned to her mind. “Very dark—and stout—and
dressed like a foreigner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Margoliouth was all that.</p>

<p>Lydia saw the room and everyone in it, in a flash, as
she closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>Miss Lillicrap, clutching her knife and fork, almost
as though she were afraid that her food might be
snatched from her plate while she peered across the
room with eager, malevolent curiosity—Miss Nettleship,
suddenly silent in the midst of some babbled
triviality, and evidently undecided whether to get up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
or to remain seated—Mrs. Bulteel, her sharp gaze fixed
upon Lydia and her pinched mouth half open—Miss
Forster, also staring undisguisedly—Mrs. Clarence,
with her foolish, red-rimmed eyes almost starting from
her head—the youth, Hector Bulteel, his mouth still
half-full and a tumbler arrested in mid-career in his
hand—his father’s sallow face turned towards the door,
wrinkled with an evident discomfiture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Margoliouth herself had raised a pair of black,
hostile-looking eyes, set in a heavy, pasty face, to fix
them upon Lydia.</p>

<p>Irene had stopped her shuffling progress round the
table, and turned her head over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Only Margoliouth remained with his head bent over
his plate, apparently absorbed in the food that he was
sedulously cutting up into small pieces.</p>

<p>In the momentary silence Lydia advanced. Her
heart was beating very quickly, but she was conscious
of distinct exhilaration, and she remembered to tilt
her chin a little upward and to walk slowly.</p>

<p>There was the sudden scraping of a chair, and pale,
ugly Mr. Bulteel had sprung forward, and come down
the room to meet her.</p>

<p>The unexpected little act of chivalry, which obviously
came as a surprise to himself as to everybody else,
nearly startled Lydia out of her predetermined composure.</p>

<p>She looked up at him and smiled rather tremulously,
and he pulled out her chair for her, and waited until
she was seated before returning to his own place again.</p>

<p>The meal went on, and the atmosphere was electric.
Contrary to her custom, Miss Nettleship made no attempt
at introducing the new-comer, and Margoliouth
did not seek to rectify the omission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>He ate silently, his eyes on his plate. Twice Lydia
addressed small, commonplace remarks to him, each
time in the midst of a silence, wherein her voice
sounded very clear and steady. He answered politely
but briefly, and the other women at the table exchanged
glances, and one or two of them looked admiringly at
Lydia.</p>

<p>It was this consciousness that kept her outwardly
composed, for she found the position far more of an
ordeal than she had expected it to be. She was even
aware that, under the table, a certain nervous trembling
that she could not repress was causing her knees to
knock together.</p>

<p>She felt very glad when the meal was over and old
Miss Lillicrap—who always gave the signal for dispersal—had
pushed her chair back, and said venomously:</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say, ‘Thank you for my good dinner.’
The fowl was tough, and I didn’t get my fair share of
sauce with the pudding.”</p>

<p>“Are we having a rubber to-night?” Miss Forster
inquired loudly of no one in particular, with the evident
intention of silencing Miss Lillicrap.</p>

<p>Lydia saw Mrs. Bulteel frown and shake her head,
as though in warning.</p>

<p>Margoliouth, however, had at last looked up.</p>

<p>“I’m not playing to-night,” he said sullenly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t your wife play Bridge?” Miss Forster inquired
rather maliciously.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You’re tired with your journey perhaps,” piped
Mrs. Clarence, looking inquisitively at the stranger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Margoliouth stared back at her with lack-lustre
and rather contemptuous-looking black eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“What journey?” she said in a thick voice. “I’ve
only come up from Clapham, where we go back on
Monday. Our house is at Clapham. The children are
there.”</p>

<p>“The children?” repeated Mrs. Clarence foolishly.</p>

<p>“We have five children,” said Mrs. Margoliouth impassively,
but she cast a fierce glance at her husband as
she spoke.</p>

<p>Miss Forster suddenly thrust herself forward, and
demonstratively put her arm round Lydia’s waist.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going upstairs to your scribbling,
as usual, you naughty girl?” she inquired affectionately.</p>

<p>“I ought to,” Lydia said, smiling faintly. “It isn’t
cold in my room now that I’ve got a little oil-stove.
I got the idea from a girl I went to supper with the
other night, who lives in rooms.”</p>

<p>“How splendid!” said Miss Forster, with loud conviction,
her tone and manner leaving no room for doubt
that she was paying a tribute to something other than
the inspiration of the oil-stove.</p>

<p>Lydia smiled again, and went upstairs.</p>

<p>The other boarders were going upstairs too, and as
Lydia turned the corner of the higher flights that led
to her own room, she could hear them on the landing
below.</p>

<p>“I do think that girl’s behaving most splendidly!”</p>

<p>Miss Forster’s emphatic superlatives were unmistakable.</p>

<p>“She looks like a sort of queen to-night,” said an
awed voice, that Lydia recognized with surprise as
belonging to the usually inarticulate Hector Bulteel.</p>

<p>She had not missed her effect, then.</p>

<p>Lydia did not write that evening. She went to bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
almost at once, glad of the darkness, and feeling
strangely tired. After she was in bed she even found,
to her own surprise, that she was shedding tears that
she could not altogether check at will.</p>

<p>Then, after all, she <i>minded</i>?</p>

<p>Lydia could not analyze her own emotion, and as the
strain of the day relaxed, she quietly cried herself to
sleep like a child.</p>

<p>But the eventual analysis of the whole episode, made
by Lydia with characteristic detachment, brought home
to her various certainties.</p>

<p>Margoliouth’s defection had hurt her vanity slightly—her
heart not at all.</p>

<p>She could calmly look back upon her brief relations
with him as experience, and therefore to be valued.</p>

<p>But perhaps the conviction that penetrated her mind
most strongly, was that one which she faced with her
most unflinching cynicism, although it would have
vexed her to put it into words for any other human
being. No grief or bereavement that her youth was
yet able to conceive of could hurt her sufficiently to
discount the lasting and fundamental satisfaction of
the <i>beau rôle</i> that it would bestow upon her in the view
of the onlookers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Broken</span> heart? Nonsense. People with broken
hearts don’t eat chestnut-pudding like that,” quoth
Grandpapa.</p>

<p>Lydia would have preferred to make her own explanations
at Regency Terrace, but Miss Nettleship
had already written a long letter to Aunt Beryl, as
Lydia discovered when she reached home on Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl took the affair very seriously, and made
Lydia feel slightly ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Trifling like that with a young girl, and him a married
man the whole of the time!” said Aunt Beryl indignantly.</p>

<p>“It’s all <i>right</i>, auntie,” Lydia made rather impatient
answer. “I didn’t take it seriously, you know.”</p>

<p>“How did he know you weren’t going to? Many a
girl has had her heart broken for less.”</p>

<p>It was then that Grandpapa uttered his unkind allusion
to Lydia’s undoubted appreciation of her favourite
chestnut-pudding, made in honour of her arrival by
Aunt Beryl herself.</p>

<p>Lydia knew very well that Grandpapa would have
been still more disagreeable if she had pretended a
complete loss of appetite, and she felt rather indignant
that this very absence of affectation should thus come
in for criticism.</p>

<p>Although she had only been away four months, the
house seemed smaller, and the conversation of Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Beryl and Uncle George more restricted. She was not
disappointed when her aunt told her that their Christmas
dinner was to be eaten at midday, and that there
would be guests.</p>

<p>“Who do you think is here, actually staying at the
‘Osborne’?” Miss Raymond inquired.</p>

<p>Lydia was unable to guess.</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Evelyn, with Olive. They’ve been
worried about Olive for quite a time now—she can’t
throw off a cold she caught in the autumn, and, of
course, there <i>have</i> been lungs in the Senthoven family,
so they’re a bit uneasy. Aunt Evelyn brought her
down here for a change, and Bob’s coming down for
Christmas Day. They keep him very busy at the office
now. Don’t you ever run across him in town, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“No, never,” said Lydia, with great decision.</p>

<p>She had no wish to meet Bob Senthoven in London,
although she was rather curious to see both her cousins
again.</p>

<p>She caught sight of him in church on Christmas
morning, where she decorously sat between Aunt Beryl
and Uncle George, in the seats that had been theirs ever
since Lydia could remember.</p>

<p>Bob, who was on the outside, did not look as though
he had altered very much. He was still short and
stocky, with hair combed straight back and plastered
close to his head.</p>

<p>Olive, much taller than her brother, was dressed in
thick tweed, with a shirt and tie, and the only concession
to her invalidhood that Lydia could see, was a
large and rather mangy-looking yellow fur incongruously
draped across her shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Senthoven’s smaller, slighter figure was completely
hidden from view by her offspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>As they all met outside the church door, Lydia, in
thought, was instantly carried back to Wimbledon
again, and her sixteenth year.</p>

<p>“Hullo, ole gurl!” from Olive.</p>

<p>“Same to you and many of ’em,” briefly from Bob,
in reply to anticipated Christmas greetings.</p>

<p>“We’ll all walk back to the Terrace together, shall
we?” suggested Aunt Beryl, on whose mind Lydia
knew that elaborate preparations for dinner were
weighing. “Grandpapa will want to wish you all a
Merry Christmas, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Aunt Evelyn, not without reason, looked nervous,
nor did Grandpapa’s greeting serve to reassure her.</p>

<p>“Why does little Shamrock bark at you so, my
dear?” he inquired of Olive, with a pointed look at her
short skirts. “I’m afraid he doesn’t like those great
boots of yours.”</p>

<p>It was quite evident that Grandpapa’s opinion of the
Senthoven family had undergone no modification.</p>

<p>They sat round the fire lit in the drawing-room in
honour of the occasion, and Aunt Beryl hurried in and
out, her face flushed from the kitchen fire, and hoped
that they’d “all brought good appetites.”</p>

<p>“There’s the bell, Lydia! I wonder if you’d go
down, dear? I can’t spare the girl just now, and it’s
only Mr. Almond.”</p>

<p>Lydia willingly opened the door to her old friend,
and received his usual, rather precise greeting, together
with an old-fashioned compliment on the roses that
London had not succeeded in fading. She took him up
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Greetings of the season, ladies and gentlemen all,”
said Mr. Monteagle Almond, bowing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Rum old buffer,” said Bob to Lydia, aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>She smiled rather coldly.</p>

<p>She felt sure that although the Bulteels and Miss
Forster—who, after all, was the friend of Sir Rupert
and Lady Honoret—might have accepted Mr. Almond
and his out-of-date gentility, they would never have
approved of Bob and Olive, with their witless, incessant
slang.</p>

<p>“Now, then!” said Aunt Beryl, appearing in the
doorway divested of her apron, and with freshly
washed hands. “Dinner’s quite ready, if the company
is. George, will you lead the way with Evelyn?—Olive
and Mr. Almond—that’s right—now, Bob, you haven’t
forgotten the way to the dining-room—or, if you have,
Lydia will show you—and I’ll give Grandpapa an
arm.”</p>

<p>Aunt Beryl, for once, was excited and loquacious.
Giving Grandpapa an arm, however, was a lengthy
process, so that she missed the appreciative exclamations
with which each couple duly honoured the festive
appearance of the dining-room.</p>

<p>“How bright it looks!” cried Aunt Evelyn. “Now,
doesn’t it look bright?”</p>

<p>“Most seasonable, I declare,” said Mr. Almond, rubbing
his hands together.</p>

<p>“Oh, golly! crackers!”</p>

<p>“My eye, look at the mistletoe!” said Bob, and
nudged Lydia with his elbow. Lydia immediately affected
to ignore the huge bunches of mistletoe pendant
in the window and over the table, and admired instead
the holly decorating each place.</p>

<p>“A very curious old institution, mistletoe,” said
Uncle George, and seemed disappointed that nobody
pursued the subject with a request for further information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>When they were all seated, and Grandpapa had leant
heavily upon his corner of the table, and found a piece
of holly beneath his hand, and vigorously flung it into
the enormous fire blazing just behind his chair, Uncle
George said again:</p>

<p>“Probably you all know the old song of the ‘Mistletoe
Bough,’ but I wonder whether anyone can tell me
the origin——”</p>

<p>“We’ll come to the songs later on, my boy,” said
Grandpapa briskly. “Get on with the carving. Have
you good appetites, young ladies?”</p>

<p>Olive only giggled, but Lydia smiled and nodded,
and said, “Yes, Grandpapa, very good.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t nod your head like a mandarin at me.
I can hear what you say very well,” said Grandpapa,
and Lydia became aware that she had instinctively
been pandering to the Senthoven view that Grandpapa
was a very old man indeed, with all the infirmities
proper to his age.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinner was very well cooked, and
very long and very hot, and conformed in every way
to tradition.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the seasoning in the turkey, George,”
said Aunt Beryl agitatedly. “There’s plenty more
where that comes from. Give Lydia a little more seasoning—she
likes chestnut. Sausage, Evelyn? Sausage,
Mr. Almond? Bob, pass the sauce-boat to your
sister, and don’t forget to help yourself on the way.
There’s gravy and vegetables on the side.”</p>

<p>Everyone ate a great deal, and the room grew hotter
and hotter, so that the high colour on Olive Senthoven’s
face assumed a glazed aspect, and the fumes from the
enormous dish in front of Uncle George rose visibly
into the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Presently Gertrude brought the plum-pudding, blazing
in a blue flame, and with a twig of holly sticking
from the top, and much amusement was occasioned by
the discovery that several of the slices contained a small
silver emblem. Mr. Monteagle Almond solemnly disinterred
a thimble, and Bob, with a scarlet face, a
wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Under cover of Olive’s screams on the discovery of
a three-penny bit on her own plate, he pushed the ring
over to Lydia.</p>

<p>“I shall give it to you,” he muttered gruffly.</p>

<p>After the plum-pudding, they ate mince-pies, and a
little spirit was poured over each and a lighted match
applied by Uncle George, Mr. Almond or Bob, Aunt
Beryl and Aunt Evelyn, in accordance with the usage
of their day, each uttering a small scream as the flame
shot up. When the mince-pies were all finished, the
dessert dishes were pulled out from under the piled-up
heaps of crackers and holly surmounting them.</p>

<p>The dessert was also traditional—oranges, nuts,
apples, raisins, almonds. Everybody avoided direct
mention of these last from a sense of delicacy, until
Mr. Monteagle Almond himself remarked humorously:</p>

<p>“I think I will favour my namesake, if the ladies will
pardon an act of cannibalism.”</p>

<p>Upon which everybody laughed a great deal and
jokes were made, and Bob and Olive began to ask
riddles.</p>

<p>In the midst of Bob’s best conundrum, Grandpapa
suddenly knocked loudly upon the table.</p>

<p>“Send round the port, George,” he ordered solemnly.
“Round with the sun ... that’s right. The ladies
must take a little wine, for the toasts.”</p>

<p>Lydia knew what was coming. She had heard it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
every year, and the transition from jovial animal enjoyment
to sudden solemnity always gave her a slight
thrill.</p>

<p>Grandpapa raised his glass, and everybody imitated
the gesture.</p>

<p>“The Queen! God bless her.”</p>

<p>The sentiment was devoutly echoed round the table.</p>

<p>Then Uncle George said in a very serious way:</p>

<p>“Our absent friends.”</p>

<p>And the toast was drunk silently, Aunt Beryl raising
her handkerchief to her eyes for a moment as she did
every year, in whose honour nobody knew.</p>

<p>After that healths were proposed and honoured indiscriminately.
Mr. Monteagle Almond ceremoniously
toasted Aunt Beryl, and Bob, looking very sentimental,
insisted upon knocking the rim of his glass several
times against the rim of Lydia’s. Uncle George, noncommittally
confining himself to generalities, proposed
“The Fair Sex,” and Grandpapa effectually prevented
anyone from rising to reply by sarcastically inquiring
which of the ladies present would act as representative
for them all.</p>

<p>The room grew steadily hotter.</p>

<p>Lydia had enjoyed the resumption of old festive custom
and also the additional importance conferred upon
herself as a two days’ visitor from London, but she
found herself viewing the familiar Christmas rituals
from a new and more critical angle.</p>

<p>She was inclined to wonder how they would strike
the aristocratic boarding-house in Bloomsbury, or even
the fashionable “young ladies” at Madame Elena’s.</p>

<p>Surely it was an out-of-date custom to join hot hand
to hot hand all round the table, and sing, “Auld Lang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Syne” in voices made rather hoarse and throaty from
food, and silently to pull each a cracker with either
neighbour, hands crossed, and Uncle George saying,
“One—two—three—all together, now—<i>Go!</i>”</p>

<p>Lydia felt mildly superior.</p>

<p>They adorned themselves with paper caps and
crowns, Bob sheepishly self-conscious, Lydia critically
so, and all the others merely serious. When no one
could eat or drink anything more, Aunt Beryl said reluctantly:</p>

<p>“Well, then—shall we adjourn this meeting?” and
they rose from the disordered table, now strewn with
scraps of coloured paper from the crackers, dismembered
twigs of holly, and innumerable crumbs.</p>

<p>“You gentlemen will be going for a walk, I suppose?”
Aunt Evelyn suggested, as everyone hung about
the hall indeterminately.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Grandpapa. “Get up an appetite
for tea. And you’ll take little Shamrock with you.”</p>

<p>Little Shamrock, having been given no opportunity
for over-eating himself, after the fashion of his betters,
was careering round Uncle George’s boots with a liveliness
that boded ill for his docility during the expedition.</p>

<p>“We’ll smoke a cigarette first, at all events,” said
Uncle George gloomily, and he and Mr. Almond and
Bob went back into the dining-room again.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to go for a walk, dear, do you?”
said Aunt Beryl, and sighed with evident relief when
Mrs. Senthoven shook her head in reply.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“The drawing-room is good enough for me,” said
Grandpapa, and Uncle George had to be called out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the dining-room again to help him up the stairs and
instal him in his arm-chair by the window.</p>

<p>“I say, aren’t you girls coming with us?” demanded
Bob rather disconsolately, leaning against the open
door of the dining-room with a half-smoked cigar in
his mouth.</p>

<p>“You’ll go too far for us,” said Lydia primly.</p>

<p>“Let you and me go off somewhere on our own,”
struck in Olive. “I’m game for a toddle, if you are,
but we don’t want the men, do we?”</p>

<p>“You want to talk secrets—<i>I</i> know you,” jeered
Bob.</p>

<p>Lydia lifted her chin fastidiously and turned away.</p>

<p>Her cousins had not improved, she thought, and she
was very angry when her dignified gesture inadvertently
placed her beneath a beautiful bunch of mistletoe,
hung in the hall by Aunt Beryl.</p>

<p>“Fair cop!” yelled Bob, and put his arm round her
waist and gave her a sounding kiss.</p>

<p>She would not struggle, but she could not force herself
to laugh, and she ran upstairs with a blazing face.</p>

<p>It was not that Lydia had any objection to being
kissed, but that the publicity, and the scuffling, and the
accompanying laughter offended her taste.</p>

<p>She felt almost as though she could have burst into
angry tears.</p>

<p>“Are you two girls really going out?” Aunt Beryl
inquired. “If so, I’ll give you the key, Lydia. I’m
letting the girl go home for the rest of the day, as
soon as she’s cleared up. The char’s coming in to give
her a hand with the washing-up.”</p>

<p>“That’s a <i>good</i> girl you’ve got hold of,” Aunt
Evelyn said emphatically. “She’s been with you quite
a time now, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Aunt Beryl and Aunt Evelyn went upstairs, talking
busily about the difficulty of training a servant really
well, and then inducing her to remain with one. Presently,
Lydia knew, they would go into Aunt Beryl’s
room, under pretext of looking at a paper pattern, or
a new blouse bought at a clearance sale, and they would
lie down on Aunt Beryl’s bed, with eiderdowns and a
couple of cloaks to keep them warm, and doze until
tea-time.</p>

<p>Lydia herself felt heavy and drowsy, but nothing
would have induced her to lie down upon her bed with
Olive beside her. Instead, she put on her best hat and
jacket, and a pair of high-heeled, patent-leather walking
shoes, and took her cousin out into the mild damp
of the December afternoon.</p>

<p>“What I call a muggy day,” said Olive.</p>

<p>“Shall we go along the Front?” Lydia inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s all those shoes of yours are good for, I should
think,” retorted Olive candidly. “Still the same old
juggins about your clothes, I see?”</p>

<p>The Front—a strip of esplanade with the shingle
and the grey sea on one side, beneath a low stone wall,
and the green of the Public Gardens on the other—was
almost deserted.</p>

<p>One or two young men in bowler hats and smoking
Woodbine cigarettes hung round the empty band-stand,
and an occasional invalid was pushed or pulled along
in a bath-chair. Here and there a pair of sweethearts
sat together in one of the small green shelters—the girl
leaning against the man, and both of them motionless
and speechless.</p>

<p>The sight of one such couple apparently gave Olive
a desired opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“I say, what’s all this about you falling in love with
some chappie in London?” she demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t fallen in love with anybody, that I know
of,” said Lydia coolly.</p>

<p>“But there was someone going after you, now,
wasn’t there?” urged Olive.</p>

<p>Lydia reflected.</p>

<p>“Who told you anything about it?” she demanded
at last.</p>

<p>“Aunt Beryl told the mater.”</p>

<p>Lydia perceived to her surprise that Olive did not,
as she would have expected her to do, despise her
cousin for “sloppiness.” On the contrary, she appeared
to be really impressed, and anxious to hear
details from the heroine of the affair. Lydia did not
resist the temptation.</p>

<p>She gave Olive a brief and poignant version of the
tragedy.</p>

<p>There <i>had</i> been a man—a fellow-boarder at the great
boarding-house in Bloomsbury that was always full
of people, men and women alike. He was a foreigner—a
distinguished sort of man—who had certainly paid
Lydia a great deal of attention. Everyone had noticed
it. Theatres, hansom-cabs, chocolates—he had appeared
to think nothing too good for her. Certain of
these attentions Lydia had accepted.</p>

<p>“Well, whyever not!” ejaculated Olive.</p>

<p>She worked hard all the week, and it was pleasant
to have a little relaxation, and, besides, the Greek gentleman
was most cultivated and clever—one had really
interesting conversations with him about books.
But——</p>

<p>Lydia paused impressively, really uncertain of what
she was about to say. She was very seldom anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
but truthful, and could not remember ever having told
a direct lie since she was a little girl. Nevertheless, she
did not want Olive to suppose her a mere dupe, the
more especially as she felt perfectly certain that whatever
she told Olive would be repeated to Olive’s family,
as nearly as possible word for word.</p>

<p>Lydia, therefore, said nothing untrue, but she rather
subtly contrived to convey a desirable impression that,
without any direct statements, should yet penetrate to
Olive’s consciousness. There had certainly been a
mystery about the Greek. He was very uncommunicative
about himself—even to Lydia herself. Then one
day, after he had taken her out and been more attentive
than ever, they had come in to find a foreign
woman there who called herself his wife.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s like a novel!” gasped Olive. “There’s a
plot exactly like that in a story called ‘Neither Wife
nor Maid.’ Only the fellow turns out to be all right
in the end, and the girl marries him.”</p>

<p>“I should never have married Mr. Margoliouth,”
said Lydia haughtily.</p>

<p>“But of course he’d no right to carry on like that if
he was married all the time,” said Olive. “Men are
rotters!”</p>

<p>Lydia gazed at her cousin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That woman <i>said</i> she was his wife,” she remarked
quietly.</p>

<p>“I say! d’you think it was all my eye and Betty
Martin?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But it was an awkward sort of
position for him.”</p>

<p>“Lord, yes!” said Olive more emphatically than
ever, and Lydia felt that any humiliation attaching to
the <i>débâcle</i> had been effectually transferred, so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Olive’s interpretation of it was concerned, from herself
to the Greek deceiver.</p>

<p>“Of course, it doesn’t matter to you, Lyd—a good-looking
gurl like you,” said Olive simply.</p>

<p>Lydia felt that after this she could well afford to
change the conversation.</p>

<p>She made inquiries about Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Oh, just rotting about,” said Olive discontentedly.
“I wish she and I could do something for ourselves,
the way you do, but the old birds wouldn’t hear of it.
Besides, I don’t know what we could do, either of us.
Bee plays hockey whenever she gets the chance, of
course, and goes to all the hops. She’s taken up dancing
like anything.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t,” said Olive briefly. “They’re scared of me
going off like the pater’s sister. Chest, you know.
But Beatrice is as strong as a horse. You know she’s
sort of engaged?”</p>

<p>“Who to?”</p>

<p>“The eldest Swaine boy—you remember Stanley
Swaine? Nobody’s a bit pleased about it, because they
can’t ever get married, possibly.”</p>

<p>“No money?”</p>

<p>“Not a penny, and he’s a perfect fool, except at
games. He got the sack from the Bank, and now he
hasn’t any job at all. Bob says he drinks, but I daresay
that’s a lie.”</p>

<p>“And does Beatrice like him?” said Lydia, rather
astonished.</p>

<p>“Perfectly dotty about him. He’s always hanging
round—<i>I</i> think the pater ought to forbid him the
house. But instead of that he comes in after supper of
an evening, and he and Bee sit in the dining-room in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the dark, and she comes up after he’s cleared off with
her face like fire and her hair half down her back.
Absolutely disgusting, I call it.”</p>

<p>Lydia was very much inclined inwardly to endorse
this trenchant criticism.</p>

<p>She had never been so much aware of her own fastidiousness
as she was now, on her return from the
new surroundings which seemed to her so infinitely
superior to the old. Really, it was terrible to think of
how clever, fashionably-dressed Miss Forster, or
haughty and disagreeable Miss Lillicrap, would have
looked upon Olive Senthoven and her slangy, vulgar
confidences.</p>

<p>As for the young ladies at Elena’s, they would probably
have refused to believe that anything so unrefined
could be related to Lydia Raymond at all.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lydia Raymond expressed interest and
even sympathy in all that Olive told her, and was conscious
of feeling both pleased and flattered when, as
they entered Regency Terrace again, Olive remarked
with what, by the Senthoven standards, perilously approached
to sentiment.</p>

<p>“I must say, ole gurl, I never thought you’d turn
out such a decent sort.”</p>

<p>They found Aunt Beryl, whose nap must after all
have been a very short one, preparing a magnificent
muffin-and-crumpet tea in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Auntie! let me help you,” Lydia cried.</p>

<p>“No, no. You go and take off your things.”</p>

<p>Lydia pulled off her hat and jacket and laid them on
the kitchen dresser.</p>

<p>“Are we using the blue tea-service to-day?” she
asked calmly.</p>

<p>“But you’re on a holiday, dearie! Don’t you worry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
about the tea—I’ll manage it. It’s only to get the table
laid in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Lydia, however, carried her point. It would have
made her feel thoroughly uncomfortable to see Aunt
Beryl toiling upstairs with the heavy trays, and it would
have looked, besides, as though she, Lydia, had grown
to think herself too “fine” for household work.</p>

<p>So she carried the best blue china upstairs and set it
out on the embroidered tea-cloth, and Aunt Evelyn,
who was sitting with Grandpapa, looked at her approvingly
and called her a good girl.</p>

<p>After tea she received other compliments.</p>

<p>They asked about her work in London, and Lydia
told them about the great ledgers, and the bills and the
invoices, and of how Madame Elena had practically
said that she should leave Lydia in charge of the other
girls, when she went to Paris to buy new models for
Easter.</p>

<p>She also told them about the other young ladies, of
Gina Ryott’s good looks, and the cleverness and independence
of little Rosie Graham, who lived in such nice
rooms with a girl friend.</p>

<p>“And do they make you comfortable at the boarding-house?”
Aunt Evelyn asked solicitously.</p>

<p>“Yes, very comfortable—and there were such nice
superior people there. There was a Miss Forster, who
played Bridge splendidly, and was great friends with a
Sir Rupert and Lady Honoret, who lived in Lexham
Gardens.”</p>

<p>“Fancy!” Aunt Evelyn ejaculated. “I’ve seen Lady
Honoret’s name in print, too, I’m almost certain.”</p>

<p>And the Bulteels were a nice family, Lydia said,
with a clever son who went to Gower Street University.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“A great many clever folk in the world,” said Mr.
Monteagle Almond sententiously. “And no doubt
you’ll meet many of them in London. But I think, if
you’ll excuse personalities, that you’ll find it’s as I say—the
true mathematical mind is a very rare thing in
one of your sex.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s relations looked at her admiringly.</p>

<p>Only Grandpapa, with a detached expression, occupied
himself in making a great fuss about Shamrock.</p>

<p>That night, when Lydia said good night to him, the
old man fixed his eyes upon her with his most impish-looking
twinkle.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell them about your romance, eh,
Lyddie? The broken heart, and all the rest of it. You
could have made a very pretty story out of it, I’m sure.
You only told one-half of the tale when you were entertaining
us all so grandly this evening. Always remember,
me dear, whether you’re listening to a tale or
telling one: Every penny piece that’s struck has two
sides to it.”</p>
